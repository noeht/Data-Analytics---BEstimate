Here is a glimpse at just the top ten uses of utility trailers:  1.Automobiles: From time to time it becomes necessary to haul an inoperable car or truck. Tow trucks are expensive, especially if the distance is great. A utility trailer is a great way to haul vehicles and a good investment if you need to do so regularly.  2.Boats: If you have a boat, you will need a utility trailer to get it to and from the water.  3.Lawn Care Equipment: If you live in a rural area, you may find that you need to haul your mowing equipment from one piece of your property to another. Packing equipment and loading it into a pickup truck bed can get old very quickly. A utility trailer will allow you to drive your equipment right up onto the trailer without the aid of ramps or two strong men.  4.Furniture: Moving furniture is a breeze with a utility trailer. Furniture dollies roll right up onto the trailer and you can haul more than you can with a pickup.  5.Building Supplies: Do you have projects that need to be done around the house? Pick up your own building supplies and save on delivery fees.  6.Bikes, Motorcycles, and ATVs: Recreational vehicles are best hauled on a utility trailer.  7.Livestock: An enclosed utility trailer is most often used to haul livestock.  8.Auction and Flea Markets: If you frequent auctions and flea markets, you will need the hauling capability to bring home your inexpensive and rare finds.  9.Appliances: Utility trailers are ideal for hauling appliances.  10.Debris and Trash: Loading trash in and out of your pickup bed can be cumbersome and clean up can be messy, but it would be worse to have to haul trash in your SUV. Clean up after a big job is a lot easier with a utility trailer.  As you can see, there are many reasons why an investment in a utility trailer is a smart move. I'm sure that with a little time, and its easy availability, you will come up with even more ways to use a trailer  ATV UTV SXS MOTORCYCLE BIKE TRANSPORT HAUL MOVE CAR TRUCK MOVING TRAVELING STORAGE CARGO LOADS AUTHORITY BOAT HAULING BUSINESS BUSINESS FOR SALE JOB SALES CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT STEEL RAZOR SNOWMOBILE POLARIS YAHAMA WILD CAT MACHINE AUTOMOBILE AUTO VAN TOWING TOW VECHICLE SNOW RAIN BOX TRUCK FLATBED GOOSNECK BUMPER PULL HITCH BALL WEATHER BUY WOOD Westchester County, NY Amawalk, Annsville, Archville, Ardsley, Ardsley-on-Hudson, Armawalk, Armonk, Arthur Manor, Banksville, Bayberry Park, Bedford, Bedford Center, Bedford Hills, Beech Hill, Beechmont, Beechmont Woods, Bonnie Crest, Boutonville, Briarcliff Manor, Bronxville, Bronxville Heights, Bryn Mawr Park, Buchanan, Buckhout Corners, Butlerville, Cecil Park, Cedar Knolls, Chappaqua, Chauncey, Chester Hill Park, Chimney Corners, Colonial Acres, Colonial Heights, Crestwood, Crestwood Gardens, Crompond, Cross River, Croton Falls, Croton Heights, Croton-on-Hudson, Crotonville, Crugers, Dobbs Ferry, Dunwoodie, Dunwoodie Heights, East Irvington, East White Plains, East Woods, Eastchester, Eastview, Elmsford, Elmsmere, Fairview, Fleetwood, Forest Knolls, Fox Meadow, Furnace Woods, Gallows Hill, Glendale, Glenville, Glenwood, Goldens Bridge, Graham, Granite Springs, Grant Corner, Greenhaven, Greenville, Grey Oaks, Greystone, Gunther Park, Harrison, Hartsdale, Hastings-on-Hudson, Hawthorne, Heath Ridge, Heathcote, Heritage Hills, Homestead Park, Horseshoe Hill, Horton Estates, Huguenot Park, Irvington, Isle of San Souci, Jefferson Valley, Katonah, Kitchawan, Lake Katonah, Lake Lincolndale, Lake Mohegan, Lake Purdy, Larchmont, Lawrence Park, Lewisboro, Lincoln, Lincolndale, Lowerre, Ludlow, Mamaroneck, Maplewood, Mariandale, Millwood, Milton, Mohegan Heights, Mohegan Lake, Montrose, Mount Airy, Mount Hope, Mount Kisco, Mount Pleasant, Mount Vernon, Murdock Woods, Murray Hill, Nepera Park, Nepperhan, New Rochelle, North Salem, North White Plains, Oceola Lake, Orienta, Oscawana, Ossining, Park Hill, Parkside, Peekskill, Pelham, Pelham Manor, Philipse Manor, Pinebrook, Pinebrook Heights, Pleasantside, Pleasantville, Pocantico Hills, Port Chester, Pound Ridge, Purchase, Purdys, Purdys Grove, Quaker Ridge, Quarry Heights, Residence Park, Ridgeway, Rochelle Heights, Rochelle Park, Roe Park, Rosedale, Rye, Rye Brook, Salem Center, Sarles Corners, Scarborough, Scarsdale, Scarsdale Downs, Scarsdale Park, Scotts Corners, Secor Gardens, Shenorock, Sherman Park, Shore Acres, Shrub Oak, Sleepy Hollow, Sleepy Hollow Manor, Somers, South Salem, Sparta, Spring Valley, Stanwood, Sun Haven, Sunny Brae, Tarrytown, Thornwood, Toddville, Tompkins Corners, Tuckahoe, Twin Lakes Village, Valhalla, Valley Pond Estates, Van Cortlandtville, Vernon Park, Verplanck, Victory Park, Vista, Waccabuc, Waverly, West Mount Vernon, White Birches, White Plains, Whitehall Corners, Wilmot Woods, Windmill Farm, Woodlands, Woodybrook, Worthington, Wykagyl, Wykagyl Park, Yonkers, Yorktown, Yorktown Heights, brooklyn, queens, manhattan, nyc, bronx, staten island, long island, hudson valley",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Beautiful bike in near flawless condition. Never been down. Thousands in extra chrome and parts. ONLY 6972 MILES! I have this Harley for years, but never was my daily rider (I also had an FXR). My back no longer allows me to ride, and the Deuce has been sitting in my other homes garage for the last several years, and not ridden. House has been sold, time to sell it. Just put a new battery in it. Fires right up and runs good but doesn’t want to idle, so it will need either a tune up or some adjustment,  nothing major. I’ve attached a link to a short video with it running. Only other flaw worth noting is the clutch lever will need replacement. It works but needs attention, see photo. Immaculate low mileage Harley with lots of extras. $10500.00 or best offer.

The foot rest idea is pretty nice, we had the kind that had their feet just hang, and this one does a better job of getting a kid used to coasting with feet up. In good condition. $25  Mini kids Pedal Bike - This thing is magical! Don't put your kid on training wheels...don't do it! Buy this ridiculous Minnie mouse bike. It's way too small for any kid cognitive enough to pedal a bike BUT! Because they don't get scared of it they end up pedal riding on their own within a weekend...no joke I have seen it happen 4 times now with 4 and 5 year olds. I should hold on to it and rent it out to frustrated parents, but alas I'm cleaning out the garage and it has served our family and friends well...it is time for this bike to help another group of peeps. Seriously...want your kid to learn how to ride without those bubble wrap, nobody gets hurt, training wheels, which turn into a crutch that they milk for years...then buy this bike. In good condition. $20  Kids Pedal Bike - This is a kids beginner bike. My kids used it to advance from beginner to intermediate riders. It has front brakes on the handlebars and back brakes on the peddle. Solid little bike. In good condition. $50  Everlast Punching Bag - This Everlast Punching bag is probably 60lbs. It is in great condition because I barely ever used it. Straps are ready, no fraying, just dusty from being a good companion in the garage while I do projects. There is a ring set in the straps to attach to however you want to set it up. $40  Kids Camping Chair - These kids folding chairs feature lil animals and trees for the pattern, are tough and durable, and have minimal burn holes from campfires, seriously...only one or two per chair. These are sold as a pair. Our kids have outgrown them and we have had to upgrade. $20 for the pair.  Kids Life Vest - 2 floatation vests for kids, sold as a pair. One is for a child 30-50 lbs, the other is for an older kid, we used it for our 7 year old before upgrading, 28- 32 inches across the chest. $20 for the pair.  Truck Camper Shell - Found this beauty on our property when we moved in, thought about putting some posts under it for a makeshift shelter...then reality dawned on me 3 years later. I need to get rid of it. I will never do anything with it. You will need to bring the muscle to load it on a trailer...and the trailer. It's been raining the last week and underneath the camper IS dry. ..so that's good. $20 or trade me a 10 or 20 lb refillable certified propane tank.  Leaf Blower - Gas powered, backpack blower for sale. This is a Shindaiwa brand with big fuel tank, throttle, and kill switch. Also...I got a bit on the end of it which clears the spaces between deck boards, lifesaver! I just started it up this morning after 5 months and it took a few pulls, no joke, maybe 5-10 pulls. I have only put in ethanol free gas in this machine. It does need a 50:1 oil/gas mix. This has been a reliable machine. $125",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I belive the battery took a hit too and is no good at this point alas the no power.     A battery direct from Onyx (they build them custom for thier bikes ) in the smallest size is 900ish.  They sell one twice as large if u want to spend more on that version but it costs accordingly.    The smallest one is what my bike came with and I used to get between 25 mi In sport mode (fully unlocked top speed is approx 60mph)  and liked the power it gave but if u set it to Eco mode (20mph) u can get up to 75 mi range out of the same battery.   I used to keep in normal mode (3 modes available) which tops at 40mph and cruise about 30 to 35mph an get a solid 40 out of it approx.   It really depends how u ride it.   It is one of the most powerful E bike type machines online and has been a while.    The torque feels similar to a 125cc dirt bike.   It goes 0 to 30 in about 3.8 seconds flat.....it's so quick it can throw u if a person guns it from a dead stop and was to pull back on bars same time....yes it WILL wheelie.    Be careful and respect it ....if u lean forward and hit it hard off line it will stay down and take off heck of fast......is addictive in a major way.    Passing cars is pretty funny and ppl WILL stare......it never gets old haha.     I used it the 1st year I had it a lot till the crash then it sat no power since in hopes I'd be able to get a battery again but haven't had the spare funds to fix it sadly.    These sell for about 4k new.   And used still demand 3500 and up when u can find one.   This price is because the cost of a new battery is pretty high as I stated and to keep it fair to both myself and the person buying this to get it up and running.    You never see them this low normally....ever.  I have the black sides off the ride next to it as it sits in my living area inside so u can see all the components easy if u come look it over.     It has about 1200mi on it total.    Motor should give tons of more miles once is powered up again....1200 is nothing for an larger electric hub motor like this has.  I have the new controller as well as the one I took off (heck it might even be good still I have no idea) and also a custom real leather seat I had made by Sauls in NYC (he recovers these seats to ppls liking in detail) handmade was 320 dollars.  I also will include the stock seat.  It has brand new racing Moped white walls from Treatland on it.....they are amazingly smooth and strong.   Not a bicycle tire at all.      The pictured pedals will NOT be included those are now on my other bike but I have extra inexpensive ones here I can give u with it.     Hate to sell it kind of but I get my DL back soon and will be back on my harleys.    So not a huge deal now for me. Your gain.  U do not need a DL or plate on this but u can Register it if u want to u can obtain the paperwork via Onyx to do that process if u like.   Since it has pedals in Oregon is an ebike if kept in Eco mode.    I can explain the somewhat hazy laws regarding this in detail in person.   But no.....if u ride it slow and be courteous of traffic etc u really do not need a DL or plate is beauty of electric bikes.  Pic is a bit old but shows sides on bike an how it looks when is ready to ride and all parts installed .  Again pedals shown do not come with it....everything else does....and more .  I will.

Here is a glimpse at just the top ten uses of utility trailers:  1.Automobiles: From time to time it becomes necessary to haul an inoperable car or truck. Tow trucks are expensive, especially if the distance is great. A utility trailer is a great way to haul vehicles and a good investment if you need to do so regularly.  2.Boats: If you have a boat, you will need a utility trailer to get it to and from the water.  3.Lawn Care Equipment: If you live in a rural area, you may find that you need to haul your mowing equipment from one piece of your property to another. Packing equipment and loading it into a pickup truck bed can get old very quickly. A utility trailer will allow you to drive your equipment right up onto the trailer without the aid of ramps or two strong men.  4.Furniture: Moving furniture is a breeze with a utility trailer. Furniture dollies roll right up onto the trailer and you can haul more than you can with a pickup.  5.Building Supplies: Do you have projects that need to be done around the house? Pick up your own building supplies and save on delivery fees.  6.Bikes, Motorcycles, and ATVs: Recreational vehicles are best hauled on a utility trailer.  7.Livestock: An enclosed utility trailer is most often used to haul livestock.  8.Auction and Flea Markets: If you frequent auctions and flea markets, you will need the hauling capability to bring home your inexpensive and rare finds.  9.Appliances: Utility trailers are ideal for hauling appliances.  10.Debris and Trash: Loading trash in and out of your pickup bed can be cumbersome and clean up can be messy, but it would be worse to have to haul trash in your SUV. Clean up after a big job is a lot easier with a utility trailer.  As you can see, there are many reasons why an investment in a utility trailer is a smart move. I'm sure that with a little time, and its easy availability, you will come up with even more ways to use a trailer  ATV UTV SXS MOTORCYCLE BIKE TRANSPORT HAUL MOVE CAR TRUCK MOVING TRAVELING STORAGE CARGO LOADS AUTHORITY BOAT HAULING BUSINESS BUSINESS FOR SALE JOB SALES CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT STEEL RAZOR SNOWMOBILE POLARIS YAHAMA WILD CAT MACHINE AUTOMOBILE AUTO VAN TOWING TOW VECHICLE SNOW RAIN BOX TRUCK FLATBED GOOSNECK BUMPER PULL HITCH BALL WEATHER BUY WOOD Westchester County, NY Amawalk, Annsville, Archville, Ardsley, Ardsley-on-Hudson, Armawalk, Armonk, Arthur Manor, Banksville, Bayberry Park, Bedford, Bedford Center, Bedford Hills, Beech Hill, Beechmont, Beechmont Woods, Bonnie Crest, Boutonville, Briarcliff Manor, Bronxville, Bronxville Heights, Bryn Mawr Park, Buchanan, Buckhout Corners, Butlerville, Cecil Park, Cedar Knolls, Chappaqua, Chauncey, Chester Hill Park, Chimney Corners, Colonial Acres, Colonial Heights, Crestwood, Crestwood Gardens, Crompond, Cross River, Croton Falls, Croton Heights, Croton-on-Hudson, Crotonville, Crugers, Dobbs Ferry, Dunwoodie, Dunwoodie Heights, East Irvington, East White Plains, East Woods, Eastchester, Eastview, Elmsford, Elmsmere, Fairview, Fleetwood, Forest Knolls, Fox Meadow, Furnace Woods, Gallows Hill, Glendale, Glenville, Glenwood, Goldens Bridge, Graham, Granite Springs, Grant Corner, Greenhaven, Greenville, Grey Oaks, Greystone, Gunther Park, Harrison, Hartsdale, Hastings-on-Hudson, Hawthorne, Heath Ridge, Heathcote, Heritage Hills, Homestead Park, Horseshoe Hill, Horton Estates, Huguenot Park, Irvington, Isle of San Souci, Jefferson Valley, Katonah, Kitchawan, Lake Katonah, Lake Lincolndale, Lake Mohegan, Lake Purdy, Larchmont, Lawrence Park, Lewisboro, Lincoln, Lincolndale, Lowerre, Ludlow, Mamaroneck, Maplewood, Mariandale, Millwood, Milton, Mohegan Heights, Mohegan Lake, Montrose, Mount Airy, Mount Hope, Mount Kisco, Mount Pleasant, Mount Vernon, Murdock Woods, Murray Hill, Nepera Park, Nepperhan, New Rochelle, North Salem, North White Plains, Oceola Lake, Orienta, Oscawana, Ossining, Park Hill, Parkside, Peekskill, Pelham, Pelham Manor, Philipse Manor, Pinebrook, Pinebrook Heights, Pleasantside, Pleasantville, Pocantico Hills, Port Chester, Pound Ridge, Purchase, Purdys, Purdys Grove, Quaker Ridge, Quarry Heights, Residence Park, Ridgeway, Rochelle Heights, Rochelle Park, Roe Park, Rosedale, Rye, Rye Brook, Salem Center, Sarles Corners, Scarborough, Scarsdale, Scarsdale Downs, Scarsdale Park, Scotts Corners, Secor Gardens, Shenorock, Sherman Park, Shore Acres, Shrub Oak, Sleepy Hollow, Sleepy Hollow Manor, Somers, South Salem, Sparta, Spring Valley, Stanwood, Sun Haven, Sunny Brae, Tarrytown, Thornwood, Toddville, Tompkins Corners, Tuckahoe, Twin Lakes Village, Valhalla, Valley Pond Estates, Van Cortlandtville, Vernon Park, Verplanck, Victory Park, Vista, Waccabuc, Waverly, West Mount Vernon, White Birches, White Plains, Whitehall Corners, Wilmot Woods, Windmill Farm, Woodlands, Woodybrook, Worthington, Wykagyl, Wykagyl Park, Yonkers, Yorktown, Yorktown Heights, brooklyn, queens, manhattan, nyc, bronx, staten island, long island, hudson valley",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Super cute! One of a kind this gal, She’s been my project for the last year. Before I got her she sat in a pasture for about 5-6 years. Figuring her out had been a bit of a challenge but, we finally got it.  HER NEEDS: She needs consistency. 6-7 days working. She needs to be doing something. More than a two day break she’ll get sassy.   Highly suggest loading her up and taking her out a couple times a month. Will keep the barn and buddy sourness at bay.   Light lunging before you get on is suggested to make sure she is focused on you.   Little about Dixie: She is a one person horse. Once she trusts you and knows you won’t let her get away her fits she’ll do what you ask. She needs a confident rider. Someone as stubborn as her. You CANT give in to her or she’ll walk all over you. She’s a very smart girl and she WILL test you.  But, once you get to that point with her that y’all are a team she’s absolutely phenomenal.   Her Fits: can consist of buck, kickin out, and rearing. As long as she’s consistently worked and worked before bein ridden, her fits wont be present.   She can go either way western, English, my personal favorite bareback. She’s been exposed to so many things. She loves barrels. She’s loves working her brain. I’ve worked a couple cows on her and she did well. I’ve thrown a rope off her just on a dummy, doesn’t even phase her. She’s been around tractors, 4 wheelers, dirt bikes, dogs, goats, chickens, a donkey, gun shots from afar, compound bow bein shot and kids. She does well with everything! She’s absolutely bombproof.  I could go on and on about this sweet stubborn girl. Call/text or email for more info & price!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I got quoted number that I wasn't willing to pay for a complete rebuild so I'm offering it up for someone who knows more than me.
