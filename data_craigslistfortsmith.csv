They let you ride just about anywhere. Plus, their upright seating and sensible riding position let you rack up the miles in comfort. But they face a challenge, too: they need to combine state-of-the-art touring and riding technology with total reliability.And that’s why Honda Africa Twin models are so far out in front of all the rest. Technology? Check out things like Apple CarPlay™, Android Auto™, and of course our available automatic DCT transmission. Reliability? Nobody even comes close to Honda there. Comfort? Hey, you’re talking about the people who build the Gold Wing. Off-road performance? Ever heard of the Baja 1000 or the Dakar Rally? All that expertise goes into every Africa Twin we build.For 2022 we’re offering four different Africa Twin models. Our standard Africa Twin is a great choice for serious off-road enthusiasts, with either a six-speed manual transmission or our optional DCT. For long-distance adventure touring, check out our two Africa Twin Adventure Sports ES models: They offer special features like electronically controlled suspension, an adjustable windscreen, larger fuel tank, heated grips, tubeless tires, and more. They too are available with either manual transmission or DCT. And every Africa Twin in our line features Android Auto this year, along with new control settings and a tasty new color choice.Features may include:POWER1084cc TWIN-CYLINDER ENGINEThe CRF1100L Africa Twin sports one of the best engines ever in an adventure bike. The parallel-twin design is narrow, and delivers torque everywhere from idle to redline. You’ll have more grunt down low, and cruise easy on the open road.ENGINEERINGCRUISE CONTROLHere’s one of the worst-kept secrets in the motorcycling world—Honda Africa Twins make great long-distance touring bikes. To that end, we’ve equipped our Africa Twin models with cruise control, just like our Gold Wings. Your next adventure really starts a couple of hundred miles away? No problem!HANDLINGLONG-TRAVEL FRONT SUSPENSIONThe Africa Twin doesn’t just look like an adventure bike—it’s the real deal. Exhibit A: Check out its long-travel front suspension. The inverted Showa fork is fully adjustable with huge 45mm tubes and 9.1 inches of travel—the most front-end travel in the 1000cc off-road class.CONVENIENCEApple CarPlay™ AND ANDROID AUTO™ Apple CarPlay™* seamlessly integrates your compatible iPhone®* into your new Africa Twin, and Android Auto™ does the same for your Android phone. That means you can use your devices to access maps, music, and other services easily. You’ll have access to weather, playlists and telephone numbers while aboard. Available Bluetooth®-enabled wireless headsets let you communicate more easily than ever. And best of all, with more apps available every day, your bike’s technology and convenience remain on the cutting edge.Sunrise Honda of Rogers1050 WEST HUDSON RD.Rogers, AR 72756Ask for: SALES STAFFPrimary Phone: (479) 903-7373A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 34305924 10416589",,,,,,,,,,,,

RIDE FARTHER.Has there ever been a time when we’ve appreciated a bike like the Honda Gold Wing as much as we do today? It’s designed to let you get out and explore—and to share that precious time with a like-minded companion. You’ll discover (or rediscover) just how much we all need to reconnect with the great outdoors. With its famously smooth 1833 six-cylinder engine, refined bodywork for weather protection, and ample luggage, where you go—and for how long—is totally up to you. Plus, this latest generation of Gold Wing is lighter and more agile, with a level of performance most touring bikes can only dream of. Full of innovative engineering, all Gold Wing models are Android Auto™ compatible, as well as offering Apple CarPlay™ integration. You can choose between a conventional six-speed transmission and Honda’s exclusive automatic seven-speed DCT transmission, depending on the model. And make sure you check out the new color options for 2022!Features may include:PERFORMANCEENGINEThe Gold Wing’s horizontally opposed six-cylinder engine is famously smooth and powerful. The latest version is an 1833cc design that’s over 13 pounds lighter than the previous generation (more than 8 pounds for the DCT versions).HANDLINGDOUBLE WISHBONE FRONT SUSPENSIONOne look and your eyes will immediately go to the Gold Wing’s radical, Honda-engineered double-wishbone front suspension. The innovative design lets us move both the engine and the rider/passenger closer to the front wheel, giving you more room for added comfort as well as stellar handling. ENGINEERINGTHROTTLE BY WIREThe 2022 Gold Wing’s throttle-by-wire system enables features like the bike’s four ride modes and our exclusive Honda Selectable Torque Control (HSTC).COMFORT AND CARGOLARGER TRUNKThe Gold Wing’s trunk now holds 61 liters, up 11 liters from the 2020 model. That means in most cases you can get two XXL full-face helmets in there. Combined, the trunk and saddlebags give you 121 liters of storage, plenty to hold what you need for a weekend’s travels. Available accessories include an auto-on interior light, a luggage rack, and more.

And here’s the best part—they do all that with a fresh, unique look that’s worlds apart from traditional cruisers. And where some cruisers are only fun when you’re riding slow, the Rebel kicks it up a notch when the roads open up and get twisty. Built around a narrow 286cc single-cylinder engine, the Rebel 300 features Honda’s rider-friendly slipper/assist clutch. And it’s a blank canvas for customization too, with a whole bunch of available Honda accessories. Everything you want and need (including optional anti-lock brakes), without a bunch of stuff you don’t—the Rebel 300 and Rebel 300 ABS are the perfect bikes for the way we ride now.Features may include:STYLEBLACKED-OUT STYLEThe Rebel is a blank canvas for your self expression and customization. But unlike the canvas you buy at the art store, this one’s not boring white. As is, its blacked-out engine pieces, frame, and bodywork elements look great during the day and even better at night.COMFORTLOW SEAT HEIGHTWhen it comes to seat heights, almost everyone likes them lower. At just 27.2 inches, the Rebel has one of the lowest seats in anyone’s lineup. It’s comfortable when you ride, and it makes it easier to flat-foot it at stoplights or in parking lots.ENGINEERINGSLIPPER/ASSIST CLUTCHIntroduced last year, this is technology first developed and perfected in Honda’s racing machines. The slipper/assist clutch means you get a lighter clutch pull at the lever, but a solid lockup when you release the lever and apply power. It’s technology that reduces clutch effort at the bar by about 30 percent.PERFORMANCESPORTY ENGINEHondas are famous for their engines, and we’ve given the Rebel 300 a great one. First, the facts: it’s a single-cylinder with fuel injection, double-overhead cams and a counterbalancer. Because it’s a single, it’s light and super narrow, which helps reduce the overall bike’s weight. It also offers the kind of torque and midrange power that’s well suited for all levels of riders.Sunrise Honda of Rogers1050 WEST HUDSON RD.Rogers, AR 72756Ask for: SALES STAFFPrimary Phone: (479) 903-7373A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 34162695 10355459",,,,,,,,,,,,

Check out the all-new 2022 Honda Grom, probably the most fun you’ll ever have on two wheels. There’s especially big news this year, because we’ve made some huge improvements to this little pocket rocket. A new engine, with a higher 10:1 compression ratio that increases power and adds to the bike’s zippy performance. And an extra gear in the transmission—that’s right, it’s a five-speed now. Updated digital instruments. Plus a thicker, flatter seat that’s more comfortable and a better fit for taller riders. But the biggest news of all are the Grom’s new body panels. They give the Grom a fresh new look, and they’re easy to remove for customizing your ride. You even get fuel injection, a bigger fuel tank, and optional ABS. So…more comfortable, more powerful, readily customizable and a fun factor that’s off the charts—bring on the Gromance!Features may include:PERFORMANCE125cc FUEL-INJECTED ENGINEFor 2022, the Grom gets a new engine with higher compression. Nobody can match Honda’s reputation for engines, and even though the Grom may be compact, it’s a giant in terms of performance and reliability.COMFORTLOW SEAT HEIGHTAt just 30 inches the Grom makes it easy to flat-foot it in parking lots or at stop lights. Plus, the new seat is flatter and features thick padding so it’s more comfortable, especially for taller riders.ENGINEERINGHYDRAULIC DISC BRAKESThe Grom features 220mm front and 190mm rear single disc brakes for excellent stopping power.STYLEALL-NEW BODYWORKPart of the fun of owning and riding a Grom is the way it looks. So for 2022 we’ve given the Grom some tasty new bodywork. Plus, it’s easy to remove if you want to customize it even further. In addition, the engine, exhaust, wheels and swingarm are all blacked out for an edgy look.Sunrise Honda of Rogers1050 WEST HUDSON RD.Rogers, AR 72756Ask for: SALES STAFFPrimary Phone: (479) 903-7373A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 34282849 10416596",,,,,,,,,,,,
