Our Samson MID DRIVES start at $2449 and range up to $2649 based on frame and battery choice. The ORION is a purpose built hunting bike that will literally climb a mountain to get that illusive elk. The long list of upgrades includes full suspension, hydraulic brakes, 1650 watts of power, and a 52 volt, 20 AH battery...The list goes on, and on. These are very well suited for off road riders, hunters, beach riders, or anyone who loves a ton of power. The Samson Mid Drives are not your everyday Ebike. Unlike the usual ""Amazon bike"" or some local flavor, These are built to put out a lot of power. They are designed to climb hills, travel fast for commuting, or excel at beach riding. We use a 48 or 52 volt 20 AH battery for outstanding range. Many SAMSON HD riders say they are getting in excess of 50 miles with normal, everyday riding. Most bikes can come with fenders, racks, lights, and many other accessories. We also offer some bikes that are more suited for street use such as ""RADIUS,"" our street bike or ""Northwest Fox,"" our recumbent electric bike. Both come with the powerful BAFANG 750 mid drive.
