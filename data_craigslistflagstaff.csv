Please note: We carry every charger/connector plug combination so if you do not see the combination for your cart, it's just that we did not post a picture; we have every combination in stock.  SMART CHARGER FEATURES: MAINTENANCE MODE (AUTOMATIC STOP / RESTART): Automatically stops charging when the batteries are fully charged and continues monitoring the battery's voltage and restarts charging automatically when it detects a preset voltage drop, replenishing energy with pulse current.

Prevents new batteries from becoming sulfated and rejuvenates older good working batteries by automatically dissolving harmful sulfation, by using safe high-frequency pulse technology. Patented WAVE Technology increases battery efficiency, extends battery life by 2-3 times and keeps batteries from failing prematurely due to suffocating sulfate crystals, hence reducing early battery replacement costs OVERCHARGE PROTECTION: Never worry about overcharging, as the charger automatically stops when batteries reach set voltage. Should you have a bad battery or batteries, the charger will safely and optimally charge the batteries without overcharging the good batteries EXTENDS THE WORKING LIFE OF YOUR BATTERIES: The Smart Charging characteristics of our Desulfating Battery Charger will dramatically increase the life of the batteries ELECTRICITY SAVINGS: Rejuvenated batteries charge quicker and reduce electricity consumption NO SPARK CHARGING, REVERSE POLARITY AND SHORT CIRCUIT PROTECTION: Prevents the output leads from sparking due to accidental reverse connection or short circuit DIGITAL AMP/VOLTMETER: Displays charge VOLTAGE, CURRENT and other useful information such as battery test and protection codes COMPACT AND CONVENIENT & EFFICIENT Small and light, adopting switch-mode technology aka Switching Power Supply.

This bike has been meticulously maintained and is the best one you'll find for sale. I've put nearly 17 grand into it in parts and labor. Unfortunately, I just can't ride anymore so my loss is your gain. I've babied this bike and no expense has been spared on it. Below is a list of all the aftermarket parts, which are the best you can find for these bikes. If you have any questions please let me know. Test rides will only happen with cash in hand and a valid MC license. I also have some gear that I may throw in depending on the offer. I also have a ton of extra parts that go with it. This is the most comfortable and versatile bike I've owned that didn't cost 30k. I've had two of these and they are bulletproof I put over 100,000 miles on the last one without any major issues. It has plenty of power for cruising on the highway and is much sportier than it looks. Easily ride two-up, without a care. and it's comfortable on long-distance trips. I averaged around 60mpg on the highway and was much better in town. I'm sure there's something I'm missing but come and take a look and you'll agree it's a great bike.

Why? Because they last forever and are light on maintenance. In fact, I have ridden this bike for 9 years and spent around $500, mostly on oil changes. I bought it in 2013 when it was 4 years old from a lady in Tuscon who just contracted ALS. I am retired and ride purely for pleasure - bike still has low mileage and I've kept her nearly in new condition. I really want to sell this bike but please don't lowball me -- I'm a stubborn fellow and I know the market.",,,,,,,,,,,

There has always been some discrepancy as to what exactly a remanufactured is. Some may ask, ""Is it just the same as a rebuilt engine ?""  Actually, it is not! What makes a remanufactured engine not a rebuilt or used engine ? Remanufacture means to make as new as possible.  Our remanufactured engines go through a strict process at our Manufacturing Facility that involves the disassembly and assembly of the engine.  New parts are added such as pistons, gaskets, and bearings. The engines are spin tested and engine pressure tested after assembly.  Our professionally trained technicians work diligently through this process to remanufacture engines to make them match factory specifications.  chrysler, dodge and jeep/ Durango, Ram, Sebring, Intrepid, Concord, LHS, 300C, Liberty, Magnum, Cherokee, Dakota, Grand Cherokee  2 in stock   Chevy - suburban, yukon, GMC, Silverado.

We understand that money is tight and replacing your engine can be fairly expensive. However, buying replacement engine ultimately can be more  cost efficient than buying a new or used car, truck, van, or SUV. Buying a remanufactured engine not only saves you money in comparison to buying  a new or used vehicle, it will be able to put your vehicle back on the road with an engine matching factory specifications.
