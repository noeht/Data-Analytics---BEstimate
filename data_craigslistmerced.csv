Here is a glimpse at just the top ten uses of utility trailers:  1.Automobiles: From time to time it becomes necessary to haul an inoperable car or truck. Tow trucks are expensive, especially if the distance is great. A utility trailer is a great way to haul vehicles and a good investment if you need to do so regularly.  2.Boats: If you have a boat, you will need a utility trailer to get it to and from the water.  3.Lawn Care Equipment: If you live in a rural area, you may find that you need to haul your mowing equipment from one piece of your property to another. Packing equipment and loading it into a pickup truck bed can get old very quickly. A utility trailer will allow you to drive your equipment right up onto the trailer without the aid of ramps or two strong men.  4.Furniture: Moving furniture is a breeze with a utility trailer. Furniture dollies roll right up onto the trailer and you can haul more than you can with a pickup.  5.Building Supplies: Do you have projects that need to be done around the house? Pick up your own building supplies and save on delivery fees.  6.Bikes, Motorcycles, and ATVs: Recreational vehicles are best hauled on a utility trailer.  7.Livestock: An enclosed utility trailer is most often used to haul livestock.  8.Auction and Flea Markets: If you frequent auctions and flea markets, you will need the hauling capability to bring home your inexpensive and rare finds.  9.Appliances: Utility trailers are ideal for hauling appliances.  10.Debris and Trash: Loading trash in and out of your pickup bed can be cumbersome and clean up can be messy, but it would be worse to have to haul trash in your SUV. Clean up after a big job is a lot easier with a utility trailer.  As you can see, there are many reasons why an investment in a utility trailer is a smart move. I'm sure that with a little time, and its easy availability, you will come up with even more ways to use a trailer  ATV UTV SXS MOTORCYCLE BIKE TRANSPORT HAUL MOVE CAR TRUCK MOVING TRAVELING STORAGE CARGO LOADS AUTHORITY BOAT HAULING BUSINESS BUSINESS FOR SALE JOB SALES CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT STEEL RAZOR SNOWMOBILE POLARIS YAHAMA WILD CAT MACHINE AUTOMOBILE AUTO VAN TOWING TOW VECHICLE SNOW RAIN BOX TRUCK FLATBED GOOSNECK BUMPER PULL HITCH BALL WEATHER BUY WOOD Westchester County, NY Amawalk, Annsville, Archville, Ardsley, Ardsley-on-Hudson, Armawalk, Armonk, Arthur Manor, Banksville, Bayberry Park, Bedford, Bedford Center, Bedford Hills, Beech Hill, Beechmont, Beechmont Woods, Bonnie Crest, Boutonville, Briarcliff Manor, Bronxville, Bronxville Heights, Bryn Mawr Park, Buchanan, Buckhout Corners, Butlerville, Cecil Park, Cedar Knolls, Chappaqua, Chauncey, Chester Hill Park, Chimney Corners, Colonial Acres, Colonial Heights, Crestwood, Crestwood Gardens, Crompond, Cross River, Croton Falls, Croton Heights, Croton-on-Hudson, Crotonville, Crugers, Dobbs Ferry, Dunwoodie, Dunwoodie Heights, East Irvington, East White Plains, East Woods, Eastchester, Eastview, Elmsford, Elmsmere, Fairview, Fleetwood, Forest Knolls, Fox Meadow, Furnace Woods, Gallows Hill, Glendale, Glenville, Glenwood, Goldens Bridge, Graham, Granite Springs, Grant Corner, Greenhaven, Greenville, Grey Oaks, Greystone, Gunther Park, Harrison, Hartsdale, Hastings-on-Hudson, Hawthorne, Heath Ridge, Heathcote, Heritage Hills, Homestead Park, Horseshoe Hill, Horton Estates, Huguenot Park, Irvington, Isle of San Souci, Jefferson Valley, Katonah, Kitchawan, Lake Katonah, Lake Lincolndale, Lake Mohegan, Lake Purdy, Larchmont, Lawrence Park, Lewisboro, Lincoln, Lincolndale, Lowerre, Ludlow, Mamaroneck, Maplewood, Mariandale, Millwood, Milton, Mohegan Heights, Mohegan Lake, Montrose, Mount Airy, Mount Hope, Mount Kisco, Mount Pleasant, Mount Vernon, Murdock Woods, Murray Hill, Nepera Park, Nepperhan, New Rochelle, North Salem, North White Plains, Oceola Lake, Orienta, Oscawana, Ossining, Park Hill, Parkside, Peekskill, Pelham, Pelham Manor, Philipse Manor, Pinebrook, Pinebrook Heights, Pleasantside, Pleasantville, Pocantico Hills, Port Chester, Pound Ridge, Purchase, Purdys, Purdys Grove, Quaker Ridge, Quarry Heights, Residence Park, Ridgeway, Rochelle Heights, Rochelle Park, Roe Park, Rosedale, Rye, Rye Brook, Salem Center, Sarles Corners, Scarborough, Scarsdale, Scarsdale Downs, Scarsdale Park, Scotts Corners, Secor Gardens, Shenorock, Sherman Park, Shore Acres, Shrub Oak, Sleepy Hollow, Sleepy Hollow Manor, Somers, South Salem, Sparta, Spring Valley, Stanwood, Sun Haven, Sunny Brae, Tarrytown, Thornwood, Toddville, Tompkins Corners, Tuckahoe, Twin Lakes Village, Valhalla, Valley Pond Estates, Van Cortlandtville, Vernon Park, Verplanck, Victory Park, Vista, Waccabuc, Waverly, West Mount Vernon, White Birches, White Plains, Whitehall Corners, Wilmot Woods, Windmill Farm, Woodlands, Woodybrook, Worthington, Wykagyl, Wykagyl Park, Yonkers, Yorktown, Yorktown Heights, brooklyn, queens, manhattan, nyc, bronx, staten island, long island, hudson valley",,,,,,,,,,,

A small exterior hatch makes turning the fridge on/off from the outside easy.  - Expandable bed that can be switched from couch-mode or full-bed mode which sleeps two.  - Captain’s swivel chair for a nice couch to lounge on during those rainy days.  - Roof vent can be opened for greater air circulation.  - A small kitchen area with counter space which fits a stove, propane tank if needed, and storage for pots and pans.  - Plenty of storage space and shelving with sliding doors.  - Black-out curtains for stealth mode and privacy.  - Interior walls are lined with insulation to help retain heat during the winter.  - Hitch for towing or bike rack attachments.  - Spare tire and jack kit included.  215,619 miles. 4.3 Liter V-6 RWD.  The van runs great and is in good shape but does currently leak oil from the rear main seal. It is not a large amount and is manageable as long as you make sure to keep an eye on it and add oil as needed. The radiator is new, as well as the catalytic converter. I have records of all the work done and available upon request.  This van is an excellent camper van for either short trips or to live in full-time. The ample storage space and refrigerator, along with large bed and lounge chair make it quite comfortable even over longer periods of time. The solar set up allows you to keep your electronics charged. Interior lights provide soft lighting.  Clean title in hand. Registration current. Smogged.",,,,,,,,,,,

A: Crazy Steve is a client of mine who is selling the family farm of 40 years & everything on it. Steve asked us to help him try to move everything off the property before he sells. Some call Steve ""Crazy"" others call Steve a ""Collector"" - No Matter what you call him - he's having a liquidation sale and everything MUST GO!!!  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: So.......what IS exactly ....... ""Crazy Steve's Bargain Basket""?  A: Crazy Steve's Bargain Basket (aka: CSBB) Is not only a place where you can find unimaginable bargains & piles of junk, it's also the resting place of ""Circadian"" a business that is no longer in operation where they processed and sold refurbished medical equipment sometime back in the late 90's. Things like treadmills, EKG machines, heart monitors and a bunch of other weird things that you have probably never heard of! You never know what you might find back there! And (im sure) things that EVEN Crazy Ol' Steve didn't know he had!    -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: This is one of the weirdest adds iver ever seen on the market place. Is this a real place? Ive never heard of CSBB before. Is the person writing this ""Crazy Steve?""  A: No! I'm not Crazy Steve! Yes this is a real place! You have never heard of CSBB before and after this liquidation sale you never will again :-O  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: Why would anyone want anything here?  A: Great question!  TBH - We have no idea!!! But, we've got LOTS OF IT. Burning Man camp / art car project? Meow Wolf art installation materials? Shelves for your garage? Workbench for your shop? Spare parts for your electron microscope? (Yep got 2 of those here) Scrap metal for smelting? I guess that's why people love junk yards so much. Ya' never know!  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: I'm interested in something I saw in the photos! I'm interested in buying it, but there isn't ANY information about the item! Does it work? Float? Power up? There is literally NO information! How can I find answers to my questions?   A: Please call or txt CRAZY STEVE'S customer service phone #. Our team will be happy to answer your questions! Many of the things here do work, and there are equally just as many things that don't. It really depends on what item you're inquiring about. Some items may need a few things to get it working again. Depending on what that is, you can do it yourself or have us do it for you. Maybe it wont cost you anything. You can just take it! EVERYTHING MUST GO!!!!  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: I'm interested in one of the boats and trailers. But I see that its missing parts & I cant hook it up to my truck to get it out of there. If I need to spend money to fix it and get it out - can I take the cost of that part and reduce it from the total price?   A: Maybe. Depending on what needs to be done / paid for, we might be able to negotiate a different price.  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: Can I just take the trailer and not the boat?  A: Nope. If you want the trailer ya' gotta take the boat too. (Steve’s orders)  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: Is everything in the photo for sale?  A: In general most of what you see in the photo is for sale. If there is a bird in the photo or maybe a small tan dog THEY ARE NOT FOR SALE. STOP ASKING. But if you saw a cat in there or maybe 5 cats they are for sale! Please ask! :-) Many of the tools you see are NOT for sale (but it might be if you make an offer!) Please contact us via phone or txt during our normal business hours (2 pm - 12 pm) - for specific questions about which items are for sale.   -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: How much are you selling the ""__________"" for?  A: You never know what kind of deals you will find at CRAZY STEVE'S! We typically ask far less than what you would find in the used marketplace. In fact, sometimes we don't charge anything at all! Remember, Steve (bless his heart) is selling the family farm and EVERYTHING MUST GO!!! If there is no price for an item, make an offer, and if you don't want to pay anything and you're willing to take it off the property, Steve might just be totally into that!  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------  Q: Im looking at a ""________"" in the photo & I see that its missing parts. I'm wondering if it works?  A: Because of the intensity & sheer volume of items (literally thousands) here on the farm we haven't really taken the time to investigate all items listed. If you are interested about something, please give a call or text to the CS department & we will be happy to assist you during our normal business hours. Typically, if there is an item that we don't have information for immediately, we will investigate said item and get back to you a.s.a.p. with our response  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: What if I get home and it doesn't work?  A: Here at CRAZY STEVE'S - ALL SALES ARE FINAL! ABSOLUTELY NO RETURNS! All items are sold AS IS.  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: I can't make heads or tales of what I'm looking at in the photograph listed. Is there any way I can just go there myself and take a walk through? Where is this place anyway?  A: YES! Honestly, that's the best way! 1/2 the stuff here at CSBB we don't even know what it is!!!!! So come on down to CRAZY STEVE'S and have a look for yourself! (Gloves, tools, mask, eye protection, etc. is recommended) CSBB is located about 10 minutes drive west of Valley Springs, about 40 mins east of Stockton.  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: I don't have a lot of tools but i'll need some to get the ""_______"" off the property and into my vehicle. Do you have tools I can use?  A: YES - There are lots of tools at CSBB (but not all tools) that you can use to get what you need. But bringing your own tools are recommended as we dont have everything you might need.   -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: Why does everything in your photos look so..... well.... crazy?

A: Please call or txt CRAZY STEVE'S customer service phone #. Our team will be happy to answer your questions! Many of the things here do work, and there are equally just as many things that don't. It really depends on what item you're inquiring about. Some items may need a few things to get it working again. Depending on what that is, you can do it yourself or have us do it for you. Maybe it wont cost you anything. You can just take it! EVERYTHING MUST GO!!!!  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: I'm interested in one of the boats and trailers. But I see that its missing parts & I cant hook it up to my truck to get it out of there. If I need to spend money to fix it and get it out - can I take the cost of that part and reduce it from the total price?   A: Maybe. Depending on what needs to be done / paid for, we might be able to negotiate a different price.  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: Can I just take the trailer and not the boat?  A: Nope. If you want the trailer ya' gotta take the boat too. (Steve’s orders)  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: Is everything in the photo for sale?  A: In general most of what you see in the photo is for sale. If there is a bird in the photo or maybe a small tan dog THEY ARE NOT FOR SALE. STOP ASKING. But if you saw a cat in there or maybe 5 cats they are for sale! Please ask! :-) Many of the tools you see are NOT for sale (but it might be if you make an offer!) Please contact us via phone or txt during our normal business hours (2 pm - 12 pm) - for specific questions about which items are for sale.   -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: How much are you selling the ""__________"" for?  A: You never know what kind of deals you will find at CRAZY STEVE'S! We typically ask far less than what you would find in the used marketplace. In fact, sometimes we don't charge anything at all! Remember, Steve (bless his heart) is selling the family farm and EVERYTHING MUST GO!!! If there is no price for an item, make an offer, and if you don't want to pay anything and you're willing to take it off the property, Steve might just be totally into that!  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------  Q: Im looking at a ""________"" in the photo & I see that its missing parts. I'm wondering if it works?  A: Because of the intensity & sheer volume of items (literally thousands) here on the farm we haven't really taken the time to investigate all items listed. If you are interested about something, please give a call or text to the CS department & we will be happy to assist you during our normal business hours. Typically, if there is an item that we don't have information for immediately, we will investigate said item and get back to you a.s.a.p. with our response  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: What if I get home and it doesn't work?  A: Here at CRAZY STEVE'S - ALL SALES ARE FINAL! ABSOLUTELY NO RETURNS! All items are sold AS IS.  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: I can't make heads or tales of what I'm looking at in the photograph listed. Is there any way I can just go there myself and take a walk through? Where is this place anyway?  A: YES! Honestly, that's the best way! 1/2 the stuff here at CSBB we don't even know what it is!!!!! So come on down to CRAZY STEVE'S and have a look for yourself! (Gloves, tools, mask, eye protection, etc. is recommended) CSBB is located about 10 minutes drive west of Valley Springs, about 40 mins east of Stockton.  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: I don't have a lot of tools but i'll need some to get the ""_______"" off the property and into my vehicle. Do you have tools I can use?  A: YES - There are lots of tools at CSBB (but not all tools) that you can use to get what you need. But bringing your own tools are recommended as we dont have everything you might need.   -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: Why does everything in your photos look so..... well.... crazy?

(CHECK OUT EBAY)  This Guzzi runs great! My nephew and his wife took it for a ride a few weeks ago.   I've owned this bike since 1987. It was originally sold by Harry's in Denver. (the oldest dealer in the nation) and I'm the second owner.   The only mods are ""Bub"" exhaust since 1981, Corben Seat, Electronic Ignition and Progressive shocks in 1993.     I went through the bike a few years ago to replace the clutch and any worn bearings and components.  I have a second '81 Le Mans II (no title) that has been a parts bike for the last 20 years. I want $2,500 for the parts bike. Both bikes have the original seats and ferrying(s) (which need some cosmetic repair). These bikes were very popular and parts are readily accessible.  Factory Motor Manual and Parts Book included.  Talk to me! We can talk about a deal for both bikes!",,,,,,,,,,,
