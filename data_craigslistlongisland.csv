This car is in great shape for its age, as it has been maintained very well throughout its life. It could certainly last another 3 decades with proper upkeep.  I bought this car last June in Portland, OR, drove it all the way down the coast to San Diego, and then back to NY. It hasn't needed much work in this time. The previous owner, who used it as her only mode of transport for nearly 30 years, was very attached to it. She kept a folder of service records from the day she bought it, which I have preserved and added to. I've also done a bit of maintenance myself, and found that it's an easy car to work on—not your typical Subaru in that regard.  Every mechanic I've brought this car to has been impressed by how clean and sturdy it is. It has a few issues, but nothing immediate or serious. I wouldn't hesitate to drive it to work and back everyday in its current shape. I'm only selling it because I moved to the city and no longer need a car.  Highlights: - 31 years of service records! - Body & drivetrain meticulously maintained; oil changes every 3k miles - No major accidents - Clean NY title in hand - Great fuel economy (31mpg on the highway in FWD) - Good for offroading (I know from experience) - Also good for car camping (see last pic) - Almost no rust (see below); no structural rust - Includes Yakima roof rack with attachments for bikes & skis - Super cool car! I get comments whenever I take it out  Recent maintenance: - 267k: new valve cover gaskets, spark plugs, wires, air filter; sender line rebuilt - 264k: new front CV axles & blower motor resistor; ducts cleared - 263k: new wipers -Tires replaced 10/2020 (still good)  Issues: - A bushing in the rear suspension is worn. This causes a knocking sound when you go over bumps or bumpy roads. Multiple mechanics have told me not worry about it, and not to replace it until the shocks and struts start to go. I'm including new OEM bushings in the sale. I noticed this issue shortly after buying the car (4,000 miles ago) and it hasn't gotten any worse since then. - There are two small rust spots: one on the front passenger side fender, and one on the trunk. Not structural rust. These haven't gotten worse since I bought the car, and could be fixed by any decent body shop. - The oil pan gasket is a tiny bit leaky. I'm including a new gasket in the sale. Easy fix for the next time you get an oil change. - The stop lamp warning light turns on whenever you hit the brakes. The old owner said this started decades ago. Doesn't cause any functional problems. The brake lamps are both good. Probably an easy fix for anyone who deals with electrical systems. - I had a new radio and speakers installed, but they aren't great. I'm including the original radio, which doesn't work, but can definitely be fixed (had 2 techs confirm). - Clock doesn't work. You can buy a direct replacement from Subaru's online parts store. - Little dents and dings here and there. It's 32 years old.  All said, this is an awesome car! I am truly reluctant to sell it. My friends are very upset with me.  $3999 OBO. Cash, Venmo, or Zelle only. Title in hand. Open to reasonable offers. Stupid offers will be ignored. Located in Roslyn. Local meet-up only. I'm usually free on Sundays & Mondays.  Feel free to reach out with any questions. Thanks for looking!",,,,,,,,,,,

For me, the answer is ""no,"" and that works out pretty well for you.  The DiamondBack Kalamar LX sold for about $200 brand new, which makes it a decent-but-lower-line model in DiamondBack's catalog.  It's a perfect bike for someone looking to tool around the neighborhood, ride some local bike trails, commute to the train station, or use as a ""Fire Island"" bike.  Here's what you may or may not want to change about this bike:  1.  It has some rust on the cassette (the chainrings in the rear) although the gears switch as well as I'm sure they ever did.  Keep it greased and you can get many miles out of it, as-is.  A replacement would be about $25 + labor at your local shop.  There is also some rust on minor parts, but it is mostly aesthetic in nature and should not affect the performance of the bike. 2.  The original chain was completely rusted out so I had to replace it with a slightly-used chain, which had to be connected via the old-school method of popping the pin in and out.  I've had chains last for hundreds of miles that way, but you might want to replace it for $10 with your own labor. 3.  The saddle has a few nicks on it that may or may not bother you.  Most people like to choose their own saddle, anyway, so you might even have one on your current bike to transfer over.  Schwinn sells a big, fat, cushy saddle for $25. 4.  I replaced the inner tube of the front tire with a brand new one; however, I only had one with a Presta-style valve, which is different than the one on the other wheel, which has a Schraeder-style (old standard) valve.  When pumping the tires, you'll need a pump that can handle both, which many current pumps do.  Usually, you have to unscrew the pump head and turn one piece around.  Otherwise, for less than $10, you can purchase a new tube that matches.  They also make adapters for a couple of dollars, but that's jumping the gun a little.  You can see that replacing all these parts before offering the bike for sale would have cost me an additional $70 or more, which means I could not sell the whole bike for $50.  If YOU would like to invest in these parts, you can still have a nice bike for about $125-150.    Unless you're looking to make this your bike-to-end-all-bikes, I don't think you need to spend anything at all on it.  Now, here's what's really cool about this bike:  1.  It's in pretty nice shape, with the exception of a few scratches. 2.  It's a 17"" frame (good for someone around 6' tall) and it's got 28"" (700 X 40c) Kenda tires (nice, large diameter for better speed with fewer revolutions of the pedals) that appear to have very low mileage on them. 3.  It's got a simple 1 X 7 (one gear in front, seven in the rear) drive system with gripshifters for easy clicking from gear to gear.  There is no derailleur on the front, which makes maintenance and shifting a lot easier. 4.  I have installed a new shifter cable and a new rear brake cable. 5.  The bike is designed with upright handlebars for an easy-on-the-back experience and better visibility for you when on the road. 6.  The Kalamar LX has connectors (braze-ons) for a rear rack that you can add on yourself, making it a great bike for commuting or riding to the beach. 7. The bike comes with a water bottle cage and front/rear reflectors to comply with local codes. 8.  It's fifty bucks.  If you are handy with bicycles, this is sort of a no-brainer, as I'm sure you can save a lot of money swapping parts off other bikes and/or handling installation of any new parts by yourself.  If you are not, the beauty of this bike is that, even after paying a local bike mechanic to perform all the optional upgrades and add-ons suggested above, it falls within the price range of the less expensive department store bikes that are hard to come by right now.  Please contact me if you have any questions or would like to come by and see the bike in person.  Thank you!", steel, hybrid/comfort," 17""", none (rigid), 28 in, v-brakes, none, riser,,,
