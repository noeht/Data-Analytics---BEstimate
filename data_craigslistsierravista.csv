I would love to continue to ride it, however a disability is making it more dangerous for me. I need to get a tricycle.  :-)  If the Juiced Bikes brand made an electric tricycle, I would buy one in a heartbeat.  This particular model is no longer being manufactured. It has been replaced with the CrossCurrent X. This bike had an upgrade of a 17.4 amp hour battery, and a frame ""brushed aluminum"" finish, whereby the frames with the highest quality welds and craftsmanship were selected, since the metal was given a clear finish.    I have primarily used the electric assist with a torque sensor, rather than cadence. This makes my peddling feel rather natural. It has different levels of electrical assist. The lowest level (Eco) is designed to just overcome the extra weight of the bike.  Levels 1, 2 & 3 provide increasing assist up to 28 mph. Level S which stands for “Sport” continues to provide assist without any upper speed limit.  The weight of the bike is significant. Maybe about 54 pounds or a little more since I have the extended range battery.  You must take that into account when braking. Remember physics … momentum includes velocity and MASS.  The bike is designed to support the extra weight with extra heavy duty spokes, frame, and hydraulic brakes.  I like the idea that the battery pack is on the front down tube and not on the back wheel. This means that one can haul some loads with the bike rack — rated for 50 pounds.  The total payload limit is 350 pounds.  I believe you will find the bike is very well thought out and designed and the craftsmanship is excellent. Customer support is pretty good as well.  There was a little bit of assembly required when I received the bike. The headlamp/light they sent had some glue in one of the receptacles. The company quickly sent me a replacement.  I also had a time or two when a fault signal appeared on the charging unit. Technical support readily resolved the issue by walking me through some simple steps.   I have an electronic copy of the instruction manual.  There are a few scratches on it when is the bike tipped over. All damage seems to be cosmetic. I had a slow leak in the rear tire and had a local bike shop replace the tube. It was a bit of a challenge for them to get the wheel off, but they managed.",,,,,

Has a Jags oil cooler installed, Iron Bags made in Eau Claire, Wisconsin and a Corbin seat. This bike was born black from Harley Davidson and after it got to the dealer in Eau Claire, WI then it was purchased and sent back to Harley Davidson for the custom paint and front fender then sent back to the dealer for the Iron Bags and Windshield because the Fat boy does not come with those option unless a special ordered them back in the day. I have the birth certificate to show it and all original paper work including original receipt. It is a great runner and has been serviced at all the correct intervals as needed. Front tire is 75% and rear tire is at 50%. New Wheel Bearing's front and back installed 10,000 miles ago. New stator and voltage regulator replaced approx 15,000 miles ago. Primary chain checked every fluid change. Reason for sale is just don't need 2 Harley Davidson's at this time in my life. Title in hand and clear. Has a couple small scratches and a very small dent on the front fender. This is a great bike and has a lot of good miles left on if taken care off. $6000.00 OBO for the bike. (Cash.). There are a few photos of the bike loaded on a Aluma 6310 aluminum trailer with fold down ramp, condor wheel chock, spare tire, straps and the bike. The trailer has bearing buddies and I have the title for the trailer also in hand. I will sell the whole package for $7500.00 (Cash) if you are interested in something like that?

I built this in the fall of 2018 and used it primarily as a desert trails runner in the Tucson Arizona area over the winter of 2020-21. It likely has about 50 miles use at the most, as my rides were almost always 2 hour 6-8 mile runs in moderate desert trails and ATV roads. This bike allowed me to get back into cycling, which I love but don’t have the endurance to take on without help. I’ve learned I can go anywhere and ride all I want, using all my own power that I’m able, but always having assistance when needed. It has ‘set me free’ and I love it. This bike works great as both a road bike and cross country trails. It is a size small, but as a 5’8” / 30” inseam individual, it’s not all that small. I found it just barely small enough. This 2018 model is more agile than the newer, more ‘slack’ 2021 frame (specs are available on the internet). This frame has a steeper head angle and shorter wheel base than the newer model. I attached a full details spec sheet as two of the images.  This bike is in excellent condition – perfectly true wheels, no dents or dings anywhere, always either covered or garaged, and everything works great. I’m 70, so I don’t ride fast nor abuse my equipment, and I’m a retired auto tech, so I keep my toys in tip-top shape. There is minor paint damage from strapping the bike down for transport and a few minor scratches; but as you can see from the pictures, it still looks great. The tires are almost new; the tubes have Slime installed. The derailleur, cassette and chain are brand new, upgrading to a Shimano Deore derailleur and from the OE 36-11 to a 42-11 cassette for better low-gear performance in steeper, rockier terrain here in the Huachuca mountains of Sierra Vista. The 20AH Lithium battery pack is brand new (I’m keeping my original LiFePO4 battery). I’m including many, many spares and all the take-offs from the mid-drive conversion.  The 750W Bafang BBSHD is from Luna Cycles, with the smallest possible chain ring (42 t), and has been programmed for hot-rod performance (not race though. It’s still limited in speed so it’s legal, but wow is it strong.) This is the strongest motor I’ve ridden; not even the 1000W units, fully unlimited, have the torque this one does. I have no idea why this is so; but it will put a grin on your face. I fitted a ½ twist RH throttle for climbing really steep stuff; it will make it, no matter what you ask of it, and that was with the 36t rear 1st gear. Now that’s an even better 42t. It’s sure to please. It will also be better for pedaling without assist now that the gearing is better.  I have $2,750.00 invested in this. I’m asking  $1450.00  I can ship this bike to any US territory at the buyer's expense. Serious inquires only, please. If you’re reading this Ad, then I still have it for sale. This Ad will come down the moment it’s sold. First come, first served.    Reply to this listing, or call or text me at Two Zero Seven Three 5 0 – Six 4 eight 4.

The closest equivalent is the CrossCurrent X, which also has a rack for panniers and fenders. This bike had an upgrade of a frame with ""brushed aluminum"" finish, whereby only the frames with the highest quality welds and craftsmanship were selected, since the metal was given a clear finish.  It also has an upgraded 17.4 amp hour battery pack, which at 48 Volts can provide 835 Watt hours. Check out the photos and look for a chart showing your potential riding range based on your speed and this particular battery pack (Super Extended). I have primarily used the electric assist with a torque sensor, rather than cadence. This makes my peddling feel rather natural.  The harder you pedal, the more power it gives to the motor. If you pedal lighter, less power goes to the motor. It has different levels of electrical assist. The lowest level (Eco) is designed to just overcome the extra weight of the bike. Levels 1, 2 & 3 provide increasing assist up to 28 mph. Level S which stands for “Sport” continues to provide assist without any upper speed limit.  The weight of the bike is significant. Maybe about 54 pounds or a little more since I have the extended range battery. You must take that into account when braking. The bike is designed to support the extra weight with extra heavy duty spokes, frame, and hydraulic brakes. I like the idea that the battery pack is on the front down tube and not on the back wheel. This means that one can haul some loads with the bike rack — rated for 50 pounds. The total payload limit is 350 pounds.  I believe you will find the bike is very well thought out and designed and the craftsmanship is excellent. Customer support is pretty good as well. There was a little bit of assembly required when I received the bike. The headlamp/light they sent had some glue in one of the receptacles. The company quickly sent me a replacement. I also had a time or two when a fault signal appeared on the charging unit. Technical support readily resolved the issue by walking me through some simple steps.  I have an electronic copy of the instruction manual.  There are a few scratches on it when is the bike tipped over. All damage seems to be cosmetic. I had a slow leak in the rear tire and had a local bike shop replace the tube. It was a bit of a challenge for them to get the wheel off, but they managed.",,,,,
