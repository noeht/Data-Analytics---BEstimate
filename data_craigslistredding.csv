Super cute! One of a kind this gal, She’s been my project for the last year. Before I got her she sat in a pasture for about 5-6 years. Figuring her out had been a bit of a challenge but, we finally got it.  HER NEEDS: She needs consistency. 6-7 days working. She needs to be doing something. More than a two day break she’ll get sassy.   Highly suggest loading her up and taking her out a couple times a month. Will keep the barn and buddy sourness at bay.   Light lunging before you get on is suggested to make sure she is focused on you.   Little about Dixie: She is a one person horse. Once she trusts you and knows you won’t let her get away her fits she’ll do what you ask. She needs a confident rider. Someone as stubborn as her. You CANT give in to her or she’ll walk all over you. She’s a very smart girl and she WILL test you.  But, once you get to that point with her that y’all are a team she’s absolutely phenomenal.   Her Fits: can consist of buck, kickin out, and rearing. As long as she’s consistently worked and worked before bein ridden, her fits wont be present.   She can go either way western, English, my personal favorite bareback. She’s been exposed to so many things. She loves barrels. She’s loves working her brain. I’ve worked a couple cows on her and she did well. I’ve thrown a rope off her just on a dummy, doesn’t even phase her. She’s been around tractors, 4 wheelers, dirt bikes, dogs, goats, chickens, a donkey, gun shots from afar, compound bow bein shot and kids. She does well with everything! She’s absolutely bombproof.  I could go on and on about this sweet stubborn girl. Call/text or email for more info & price!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Turns out on a other beach cruiser motorized bike build. I prefer mountain bikes for the hand brakes and easier to pedal gears.   Beach cruiser pedal brakes are kinda fun to do sideways or aggressive skids though.  It was sold to me as red by Walmart. Its kind of a red, pink, neon orange kinda color. But yes mostly red.   I never rode this bike. Not one bit.  Its possible my cat peed against the side of it against the wheels but probably not. Nothing a good soapy washing couldent clear up.  Its customized,   different handlebars name brand on them is fmf sport they are 650cm long lightweight strong and mountain bike style instead of the stock beach cruiser wide style.  I put new mongoose upgraded alloy pedals 9/16 size bolts. put Teflon tape on the threads so they stay in placer firmer and can be undone easily when you choose to.   I'm including red vans cult flangless grips still new in box.  I didn't believe in huring walmarts earnings for my mistake in buying a returning a beach cruiser. I'm just breaking even here. Heres my rundown of the costs.  100 Bike 15 fmf sport handlebars 15 Mongoose Pedals 15 New In Box Vans Cult Flangless  Red Grips Total: 145 I'm breaking even, Id like to. The price is firm. These are all new parts.  I assembled it very carefully as I was intending it to be a high speed motorized bike. Still you should double check all the tightness of bolts yourself before riding.   Ill include the original Huffy shipment Box, The owner manual as well.  I'm in redding near mercy hospital area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

My first on-off road of the many street bikes Ive owned. The last months I have commuted and tried a few fire roads and I love every aspect of this bike including the spectacular DCT system. The one flaw for me is that if I drop this while riding alone I don't think I would be able to pick it up. I am 60 and will need something lighter to continue this new style of riding. This bike has all of the Givi off-road equipment and heated grips, moose shield, foot peg guard, center stand, throttle lock, never used Tusk panniers, Givi trunk, Givi tank bag, bar risers, new chain/sprockets and major services completed. No issues with the bike. Would trade for the right KTM 690r enduro.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Tito"" is approx 10 years old, ground drives, is broke to lead line, ponies, longes and yield both ends, moves off pressure, ties, clips, bathes, loads, and is pretty much unflappable out and about. I can shop vac him, blow dry him (with a leaf blower), hundreds of miles of trail experience. He crosses water, rocks, hills, brush, streets, boulders, logs, bridges. Tons of exposure to bikes, dogs, heavy equipment, traffic, horses, disc golf! Basically he has seen it all. Trash and debri doesn't phase him. Adores to go out and explore. Unfortunately my life has gotten to busy for him and he has just been sitting lately. Would love to find a trail or companion home for this strinking little guy.   3k firm home check and references will be required. He is UTD on shots, worming, fecal, dental, trim, and sheath cleaning. He is just a super cool kind dude 😎",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pictures were taken as the bike sits as is.  Nothing was washed and waxed.  That is how the bike looks when I ride it.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with it.  My riding partner had a stroke and I just do not have the desire anymore.  I am the second owner. The seat is custom made ($500) by Russel seats, Shasta Lake, CA. The fuel is treated and the octane is about 96 octane.  I run it every week to keep seals oiled.  Newer battery, last summer.  I have new extra tires and windshield.  I also have every OEM Honda part to do a complete fork seal and progressive springs job.  The same for the brakes.  They do not need replacement, but I was going to do preventative maintenance anyway. The bike had a complete carburetor clean out service two years ago by Roseville Honda ($1,500.00)  I have all receipts.  There is also other equipment (heavy jack) in the pictures that go with it.
