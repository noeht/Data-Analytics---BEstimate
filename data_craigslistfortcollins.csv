The Whip XL takes things to the next level with a 21"" toptube, components made from chromoly, and every bearing being fully sealed for pro level strength and performance. The frame, forks, handlebars, and cranks are constructed out of 100% 4130 chromoly, the same material that can be found on top level bikes. Kink didn't stop there. They also included many other parts that can be ordered as aftermarket upgrades such as the Bold stem, Hemlocks, Nexus 25 tooth sprocket, and Bomber stealth pivotal seat. It's hard to believe the price when seeing everything the Kink Whip comes with.

She is the whole package. SAFE! BROKE! And Sweet as they come. Esmeralda has ridden all over, in town around heavy traffic, bikes, strollers… She will cross anything in front of her including but not limited to staircases, bridges, tunnels, lakes and rivers. Esmeralda has had ropes thrown off her, ponied cows and other horses and is great with tarps, flags and all things scary. Esmeralda is a gem with children of all ages but built like a brick house and sturdy for an adult. Esmeralda comes out of Adobe Town HMA which is known for having drafty mustangs, her build highly resembles a Haflinger as she is as wide as she is tall, drafty neck and has beautiful feathering on her fetlocks. She has strong hooves and goes great barefoot on any terrain. She is sure footed and a mount you can trust weather on slick, steep or rocky footing, she won’t miss a beat. She has been ridden out alone ad in groups and will ride in front or in back of a herd. NOT marish at all. She will meet you at the gate, stands great for bathes, grooming, tacking and takes the bridle just as she should. Esmeralda knows to lay down and is well accomplished in liberty with some training in bridleless as well. She is lower in the pecking order and gets along with anyone in the herd. She’s as easy keeper and healthy as can be. Esmeralda knows her leads and has dabbled in jumping, she is her prime and loves any job you give her. She is an amazing babysitter. Esmeralda is a bit more whoa then go but will give speed when asked and keeps up fine with a group, she’s just not one to ever be in a hurry. Esmeralda is good for bathes, great for the farrier and walks right in and backs out of the trailer. I can’t say enough good things about this mare and am so looking forward to her finding her perfect family or person. If there are any questions I can answer for you or if you’d like to meet her please don’t hesitate to reach out.  She is available through HorseBay and her sale starts Saturday.",,,,,

Honda Rebel 500 is a bike that breaks out from the world of traditional motorcycle style and escapes from the boring boulevard drone. It all starts with a narrow 471cc twin-cylinder engine with plenty of user-friendly power. The blacked-out look, light weight, and low seat height are winners everywhere, and features like Honda’s slip/assist clutch help make riding more enjoyable. And where some cruiser-class bikes are only fun if you ride slow, the Rebel 500 is happy to kick it up a notch. You can even get anti-lock brakes. Plus, for 2021, we’ve added fresh new colors, and our new Rebel 500 ABS SE, a version that comes with a selection of some of our most popular accessories, pre-installed, like our Black Diamond-Stitch Seat, Black Fork Boots and Covers, and a Black Headlight Cowl. So don’t let anyone put you into a cage—discover a new Rebel 500 and escape the ordinary.
