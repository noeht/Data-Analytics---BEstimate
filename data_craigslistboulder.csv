(Bikes in this ad are sold.) I have mostly commuters or mountain bikes as well as a few road bikes in the $200-300 range. I was professionally trained as a bike mechanic. Now in my spare time I enjoy restoring and fixing up bikes to bring them new life and add value to our community in Boulder. Most of the bikes have new shifters, tires, grips, etc. and some have been substantially upgraded. The  majority of my bikes are brand names like Trek, Giant, Gary Fisher, Specialized, Bianchi, GT, & Diamondback.   Reach out if you're looking for a quality bike in excellent condition and don't want to add to the consumer stream or pay sticker price for a new one.

If you’re not familiar with this brand, do just a little research and you will find nothing but glowing reviews by bike publications and individuals alike. They are based in Golden,CO and only sell direct so you won’t find these in any local bike shop. They are a small producer of bikes that offer all-round fun on the trails and especially excel at climbing. I love this bike soooo much that I just bought another one to replace it. I just had it fully serviced by Spot last spring and didn’t get a lot of riding last season because of the horrendous smoke last summer, so it’s in great riding condition.

Featuring a lightweight alloy frame, carbon fiber fork, and mounts for racks and fenders, it's as performance-packed as it is versatile.  Not only does a light bike feel better when you're climbing up a hill, but it's also essential when you're carrying your bike up to the 5th floor, and this was at the forefront of the frame design. With a redesigned E5 Alloy frame, the Allez features a class-leading weight. Aggressively thin-walled, yet tough, tubes have been implemented to save weight and this results in over a 450g (1-pound) reduction in the frame and fork alone when compared to some models of yesteryear.  Speaking of the fork, entry-level road bikes often times feature either alloy or cheap carbon fiber forks that greatly detract from the overall ride quality. But with a full FACT carbon fiber fork, the Allez is better handling, smoother riding, and lower in weight—floating over rough chip-seal and carving through corners like a slalom skier. For the geometry, we developed the Allez by utilizing our vast Retül fit database. This meant creating a geometry that's sure to cover a broad range of positions, while still providing the performance-minded handling you'd expect from your first bike.  This Allez also features integrated rack and fender mounts, allowing you to get weight of your backpack of you and onto a lightweight rack. This not only makes for a good road bike, but it also enables you to transform it into a fast commuter. And for the build, this Allez features reliable Shimano Claris shifting, durable Axis Sport alloy wheels, and well-protected Espoir Sport tires.

It’s a perfect commuter for a student. Accessories include padded gel seat cover, kick stand, bar ends (removable) and a nice rack on the back for toting whatever your heart desires.   Bike is 10+ years old but has been stored inside so it’s in excellent condition and rides like new. Shifts fine and the brakes work as they should. I’m 5 foot 10 and 165 pounds and the bike felt sturdy when I rode it up and down the street. Obviously several adjustments can be made to the bike to fit your size. I put a new tube in the rear wheel.   Turns out my wife will NOT be riding bikes with me so I’m putting this up for sale. Pick up preferred but I might be able to meet you halfway with this. I do get to Denver occasionally. Feel free to call or text with questions you may have. Craigslist emails typically go to spam in my experience so please just call or text. Thanks",,,,,,,,,,

This van has literally been home to me at times. I'm needing to sell only to free up some cash to go back to school. No mechanical issues and service every 20,000 miles per MB spec.   Last service was around 142,000 where I had the oil changed, fuel filter replaced, AC Compressor replaced, put on brand new tie rods, and new rear leaf springs for better handling with a heavy load.   This van has all you need and a bit more. Don't shy away from 140k in miles - as long as you treat her nicely, she'll go for 400k+ on diesel.   - Electrical system is a 12v Direct Current (DC) system. A battery is used to 1) store and 2) produce energy on demand to the electrical appliances in the vehicle. ----- with respect to storage of power, the battery stores power produced by the solar panel, vehicle alternator and 'shore-power'.   - Insulation/Walls/Floor: sound deadening mats across entire body and entire cab along with a 2.5"" aluminum backed polyisocyanate as insulation on all walls and ceilings. Fire retardant foam (in addition to polyiso) was used on the floor to seal all cracks. Walls are covered with 1/2 inch 13-ply baltic birch plywood (cabinet grade) ceiling is 1/4"" ply. Floor is tongue and groove waterproof faux wood with a nice grain texture.   - Cabinetry: all cabinets and storage were built using 1/2"" 13 ply baltic birch plywood. Extremely strong and durable, hugh ply baltic birch plywood is the gold standard for high-end cabinetry.   - Plumbing: An Ikea Vessel sink attaches to a 7 gallon gray water system. A dual action hand pump delivers water from a 7 gallon fresh water container and storage under the sink includes a second 7 gallon fresh water tank.   - Stove: three burner stove with oven.   - Refrigerator: enormous for a van at 130L. Truckfridge with Danfoss compressor.   - Electrical: 200 Amp -hour LiFePO4 battery; 40 amp hour MPPT Controller; 2000 pure sine inverter (AIMS power); 60 amp LiFePO4 battery charger/converter (progressive dynamics); 265W monocrystalline solar panel; 40amp DC to DC battery charger; battery monitor; 4 AC outlets; 12 USB outlets; LED strip lighting and LED can lights; cell phone signal booster (WeBoost); Gallo acoustics speakers  - Dinette/table/bed: 4 person booth with a removable custom table.

Underneath bed is the storage area that can fit a couple of mountain bikes, crash pads, skis, boards and more!",,,,,,,,,,

Here is a glimpse at just the top ten uses of utility trailers:  1.Automobiles: From time to time it becomes necessary to haul an inoperable car or truck. Tow trucks are expensive, especially if the distance is great. A utility trailer is a great way to haul vehicles and a good investment if you need to do so regularly.  2.Boats: If you have a boat, you will need a utility trailer to get it to and from the water.  3.Lawn Care Equipment: If you live in a rural area, you may find that you need to haul your mowing equipment from one piece of your property to another. Packing equipment and loading it into a pickup truck bed can get old very quickly. A utility trailer will allow you to drive your equipment right up onto the trailer without the aid of ramps or two strong men.  4.Furniture: Moving furniture is a breeze with a utility trailer. Furniture dollies roll right up onto the trailer and you can haul more than you can with a pickup.  5.Building Supplies: Do you have projects that need to be done around the house? Pick up your own building supplies and save on delivery fees.  6.Bikes, Motorcycles, and ATVs: Recreational vehicles are best hauled on a utility trailer.  7.Livestock: An enclosed utility trailer is most often used to haul livestock.  8.Auction and Flea Markets: If you frequent auctions and flea markets, you will need the hauling capability to bring home your inexpensive and rare finds.  9.Appliances: Utility trailers are ideal for hauling appliances.  10.Debris and Trash: Loading trash in and out of your pickup bed can be cumbersome and clean up can be messy, but it would be worse to have to haul trash in your SUV. Clean up after a big job is a lot easier with a utility trailer.  As you can see, there are many reasons why an investment in a utility trailer is a smart move. I'm sure that with a little time, and its easy availability, you will come up with even more ways to use a trailer  ATV UTV SXS MOTORCYCLE BIKE TRANSPORT HAUL MOVE CAR TRUCK MOVING TRAVELING STORAGE CARGO LOADS AUTHORITY BOAT HAULING BUSINESS BUSINESS FOR SALE JOB SALES CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT STEEL RAZOR SNOWMOBILE POLARIS YAHAMA WILD CAT MACHINE AUTOMOBILE AUTO VAN TOWING TOW VECHICLE SNOW RAIN BOX TRUCK FLATBED GOOSNECK BUMPER PULL HITCH BALL WEATHER BUY WOOD Westchester County, NY Amawalk, Annsville, Archville, Ardsley, Ardsley-on-Hudson, Armawalk, Armonk, Arthur Manor, Banksville, Bayberry Park, Bedford, Bedford Center, Bedford Hills, Beech Hill, Beechmont, Beechmont Woods, Bonnie Crest, Boutonville, Briarcliff Manor, Bronxville, Bronxville Heights, Bryn Mawr Park, Buchanan, Buckhout Corners, Butlerville, Cecil Park, Cedar Knolls, Chappaqua, Chauncey, Chester Hill Park, Chimney Corners, Colonial Acres, Colonial Heights, Crestwood, Crestwood Gardens, Crompond, Cross River, Croton Falls, Croton Heights, Croton-on-Hudson, Crotonville, Crugers, Dobbs Ferry, Dunwoodie, Dunwoodie Heights, East Irvington, East White Plains, East Woods, Eastchester, Eastview, Elmsford, Elmsmere, Fairview, Fleetwood, Forest Knolls, Fox Meadow, Furnace Woods, Gallows Hill, Glendale, Glenville, Glenwood, Goldens Bridge, Graham, Granite Springs, Grant Corner, Greenhaven, Greenville, Grey Oaks, Greystone, Gunther Park, Harrison, Hartsdale, Hastings-on-Hudson, Hawthorne, Heath Ridge, Heathcote, Heritage Hills, Homestead Park, Horseshoe Hill, Horton Estates, Huguenot Park, Irvington, Isle of San Souci, Jefferson Valley, Katonah, Kitchawan, Lake Katonah, Lake Lincolndale, Lake Mohegan, Lake Purdy, Larchmont, Lawrence Park, Lewisboro, Lincoln, Lincolndale, Lowerre, Ludlow, Mamaroneck, Maplewood, Mariandale, Millwood, Milton, Mohegan Heights, Mohegan Lake, Montrose, Mount Airy, Mount Hope, Mount Kisco, Mount Pleasant, Mount Vernon, Murdock Woods, Murray Hill, Nepera Park, Nepperhan, New Rochelle, North Salem, North White Plains, Oceola Lake, Orienta, Oscawana, Ossining, Park Hill, Parkside, Peekskill, Pelham, Pelham Manor, Philipse Manor, Pinebrook, Pinebrook Heights, Pleasantside, Pleasantville, Pocantico Hills, Port Chester, Pound Ridge, Purchase, Purdys, Purdys Grove, Quaker Ridge, Quarry Heights, Residence Park, Ridgeway, Rochelle Heights, Rochelle Park, Roe Park, Rosedale, Rye, Rye Brook, Salem Center, Sarles Corners, Scarborough, Scarsdale, Scarsdale Downs, Scarsdale Park, Scotts Corners, Secor Gardens, Shenorock, Sherman Park, Shore Acres, Shrub Oak, Sleepy Hollow, Sleepy Hollow Manor, Somers, South Salem, Sparta, Spring Valley, Stanwood, Sun Haven, Sunny Brae, Tarrytown, Thornwood, Toddville, Tompkins Corners, Tuckahoe, Twin Lakes Village, Valhalla, Valley Pond Estates, Van Cortlandtville, Vernon Park, Verplanck, Victory Park, Vista, Waccabuc, Waverly, West Mount Vernon, White Birches, White Plains, Whitehall Corners, Wilmot Woods, Windmill Farm, Woodlands, Woodybrook, Worthington, Wykagyl, Wykagyl Park, Yonkers, Yorktown, Yorktown Heights, brooklyn, queens, manhattan, nyc, bronx, staten island, long island, hudson valley",,,,,,,,,,

Ugh.   Consequently, this is your chance to snag an essentially brand-new Mosaic GT-1 45 medium-sized frame with a ""no-expense-spared"" build full of nearly impossible to find components--just in time for Spring with no 5 month wait!   See pics for geo, but this is essentially a stock sized 54cm-55cm GT-1 frame with the only tweak being a slightly steeper top-tube angle to allow for more standover clearance. I'm 5'8"" and have owned a zillion bikes, but this is easily the best handling frame geo I've ever ridden. It just works on every terrain imaginable from gravel roads to carving paved descents. Plenty of room to dial in your fit. There are 2.5cm of spacers under the stem, and the Pro handle bar has an extremely short reach and shallow drop, so you could easily go longer and lower if you like.

In order to facilitate year-round use, I have two sets of wheels/tires including 4"" fat tires mounted on 26"" rims (Kenda Juggernauts), and also 3"" plus-size tires mounted on 27.5"" rims (Schwalbe Rocket Rons). This ebike has hydraulic disc brakes with upgraded discs and pads. 52T Sram oversize chainring, 31.8 750mm riser handle bar, Adjustable stem (0 to 90 deg.), color-matched alloy platform pedals, Ergon GP1 grips, front and rear lights, and much more.

Comes with $200 black flat pedals + crank boots, new $60 specialized grips, and has been professionally converted to tubeless ($100). Cost over $6000 in Sept 2021 when I bought it at University Bikes in Boulder. All services were done there. Have receipts and University Bikes can confirm purchase etc for insurance (if you want to add to your home insurance). The bike has been registered with Specialized and has a multi year warranty.  The reason for selling is I liked this bike so much I have ordered the 'pro' version of it for this summers season since they are sold out during the warm season. The S4 sizing which is what they call large can easily fit a wide range of heights from 5'7"" to 6'1"". This size has been sold out for most of 2021 and 2022 and these bikes will have a 10% price increase for the coming season.  Serious inquiries only, can meet outside/inside Univercity Bikes or Trek Bike Shops in Boulder to show.

I am a cruiser with an internal 3 speed hub. I was purchased in February 2007 for about $700.  Electra is not currently producing cool Betty bikes like me, so I consider myself pretty special.  My owner died this year so I was rescued and brought to Breakaway Cycles in Loveland for a tune-up and cleaning ($89.50). Breakaway did a great job of sprucing me up so I shift like new and have a new rear inner tube.   My the top tubes and rear fender have some scratches as my new owner tried to show in the photos.  I have an easily removable front basket, leather tassels on the grips, and dice valve covers to highlight my pink rims. I'm a super cool bike in great shape looking for a new owner that can take me out for rides. And even though I am not one of those e-bikes I promise I will not disappoint you!!", excellent, Electra,,, cruiser, Betty, coaster, none, none (rigid), WN6L06970
