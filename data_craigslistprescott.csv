This thing is in excellent condition and has very low hours. It has electric start, on the fly map switching AWA traction control switch. They also slightly lowered these bikes at the factory for better center of gravity for veteran riders and racers who want to be able to touch the ground. The guy I bought it from was a traveling nurse and barely ever rode it. This thing is fast, light and agile just not suited for the very tight trails and rocky hill climbs I like to tackle. I put a sticker kit on it, It has pro taper handlebars, black wrap around handguards, skid plate, Mika 52t sprocket, new DID x chain to fit larger sprocket, Billet lightweight Fastway kickstand, new 18 inch black rear wheel and new larger tire for trails and upgraded vented air intake side cover they used on the 2022 models.

It was for sale in Delaware for $3,750.  I had them convert the chainring to a Wolf Tooth 30T and had it shipped (see photos for the original receipt).  I had Andrew at Bikesmith do the assembly when it arrived.  The following components are on the bike: *  Carbon frame *  Fox Float 32 CTD Fit 100mm w/Kashima Fork *  Fox Float CTD w/ Kashima rear shock *  Shimano XT Gruppo  *  Thomson/Renthal cockpit  *  DT Swiss 350/Stan's ZTR Crest Alloy Wheelset  *  Renthal Fatbar Lite Carbon 40mm rise 740mm width 31.8 handlebar  *  Wolf Tooth 30T Drop-stop Chainring  *  Brand-X Ascend 125mm Dropper seatpost (The Ascend is almost exactly the same as the PNW’s                  Bachelor seat post and likely manufactured by PNW.) *  Wolf Tooth Dropper remote   *  Older Spank Oozy platform pedals as shown in photos (these can be included if you need them or removed)   *  SQ Labs 711 ergo grips OR the still new ODI Ruffian grips that came with the bike   *  ISM Adamo Peak OR the WTB Rocket Saddle that came with the bike  The specifications are reflected in the second photo under the XL size.  I have ridden this bike 1,478 miles over 121 rides since 2018 Rides: 21/2018, 33/2019, 57/2020, 10/2021.   I also own a Lynskey hardtail which get the majority of my saddle time.  Since 2018 the Lynskey has been ridden 3,354 miles or 70% of my total miles. If you weigh more than 190 the Stan's Crest wheelset is likely to take this bike out of your consideration.  The bike as shown weighs about 26.5 to 27.2 lbs without pedals using a less than precise bathroom scale although some reviews indicate a lower weight.  The last two photos show my receipt and the bike as it was originally equipped prior to the 1x10 conversion and the addition of components like the dropper post, handlebars, grips, saddle...  I also debadged the Stan's Crest Wheelset as the decals resulted in a cluttered look (Compare the second to last photo with the first photo to compare the before and after).    You can read some reviews on the Turner Czar on these websites: Singletracks, Bike Rumor, MB Action, MTBR and the Radavist. Price is firm given the low miles and condition of the bike and components. NO TRADES.    If you are interested in this bike please call me before 8pm to take a look and a spin.", Turner, disc (hydraulic), like new, none, riser, frame and fork (full suspension), Czar,,,,,

I bought it in Italy in 2012 and used it for a couple of years. When we moved to NYC in 2014, we left the bike unused until 2020, when we decided to move from NYC to Prescott. We brought it here, I changed the tires 6 months ago, and started to ride, but very rarely, and it is a pity to leave that beauty unused. Uphill is unbeatable, while downhill, does require skills, like any high-end hardtail.  Known problems: 1. The fork has been left unused for a long time, and it does require service. It works, but it is a bit stiff, and the rebound control is hard to command. Also, one of the stanchions is slightly damaged, due to the dirt that was retained by the seal (see photo). 2.
