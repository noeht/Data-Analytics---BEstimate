The Red one is mine. 7 speed With twist shift.  brake type: caliper  Giant semi recumbent, ideal for riders with back/lumbar issues or if you have had knee replacement surgery like me and riders who want a relaxed riding position. This bike has many points of adjustment and can fit almost any size rider in comfort. It has a 7 speed hand operated shifter as well as a large rear shock absorber and large comfy saddle with back support for a lux ride. I have added a mirror ,front and rear lights for safety. The seat on this red bike does have 2 pieces of tape covering damage from previous owner.   **********      THE GREY BIKE IS     SOLD !    **********(  The Gray one is my wife’s  it is an 8 speed. It is a DX model. It also has a twist shift. The Gray one has the same features as the Red one just a little different style.  Also added mirror, front and rear lights for safety. This has the computer on the handlebars that has not worked since I got the bike.   These are great bikes. They are semi recumbent and that is a big difference from a full recumbent bike. These are a lot easier to ride than a recumbent bike. You can sit on the seat and put both feet on the ground. Easy to start the ride and stop.  This was great for me as I had both knees replaced I couldn’t ride a regular bike and a full recumbent was way to hard to ride.   Red bike $300.

Older frame, but super durable single pivot design with little pedal bob, good climbing, great weight and upgraded with great modern parts. I am 6'-4"" and fits me fine, but a bit on the small size, my brother is 5'-10"" and used it several times on trails with me no problem.   Background: I bought this as an employee purchase in 2002 after riding some freeride in Souther california on an old GT DHS, which I cracked. The Ellsworth was the best modern free-ride bike at the time, taking basic design from the mountain cycle san andreas, but with a lighter more sturdy frame. This was and is a much more durable frame than all of the other competitors. The anodized finish actually hardens the first few layers of the aluminum making it hard to scratch. The oversized single pivot with sealed cartridge bearings makes it super durable. I set this up with 7” duel crown fork for a year, had a Marzocchi Z1 spring fork and ended up with this one as the best balance of weight, travel, and feel. It still works great with no scratches to the stanchions. I rode it mostly XC, taking some decent jumps and did do some limited freeride in BC, colorado, montana, N. Dakota, Oregon, California, New York, Virginia, and Connecticut. I got a new do-it-all bike, and wife is making we get rid of some of my old bikes. This one I just put over $900 into it to make it trail ready, then I found a new Ibis Ripmo to replace it, so now I have to sell this. It is a great bike park bike, or all mountain bike.    This bike came with a Romic twin-tube shock which was awesome, but eventually needed a rebuild or replacement, so I bought a fox float replacement shock. By the time I got around to replacing it last year, the brand new shock needed rebuilding, so I paid another $150 for the rebuild, so it is new and rebuilt shock with three levels of pro-pedal easily adjusted and a lever for full-open or pro-pedal(for climbing) The romic, which I still have and will include w/ 2 springs, 550 and 650, had better big hit feel, but is also about 2 lbs heavier. The fox shock feel really good and I have been on 4 rides with it. The De Kaiser tires are stout and hook-up good in Southern California sand and rock. Can go bigger in the front but not in the back. The only upgrade you may want to do is add a dropper post, which would set you back about $200.  For sale locally and a online, feel free to contact me with questions are to set up a local test ride.

For sale is a previous bike shop mechanic owned 2004 mountain bike with mostly new parts.   Overview: This is a extremely well maintained and built mountain bike 4” travel rear and 3.5” front, very light race worthy, great trail bike, and in excellent condition and very capable by today’s standards.   Background: I recently moved and pulled this from out of my attic where it has been for about 10 years. I used to ride a lot and this was my race bike, I did several collegiate races and some 6 and 8 hour endurance races on the east coast. It does not suit my coherent west coast riding style which needs a bit more travel. This bike is super light, at 27.9 lbs. I purchased it as the second owner in 2007 and is a 100% custom build.  It uses the same Horst link that specialized does, which isolates pedal bob, and is basically a specialized stumpjumper with a more robust welded frame from the same year having basically the same geometry.  This bike is super fast and durable, great for all day XC rides, group rides or racing. I used to race on a Cannondale Scalpel, and this had a bit more suspension travel, but still had tight handling ride. I’ve had many many other mtb bikes over the years and this one was my favorite, hence why I’ve kept it so long, but time to clean out the garage. Everything works in excellent condition, all bearings good, all parts and suspension in perfect condition, with the exception of the ronin rebound and compression knobs are seized, but the fork feels buttery smooth, holds air perfect and had great bump responsiveness and compression, since it siezed in my sweet spot of adjustment. It may be able to by unseized with some anti-seize spray, I haven’t tried. I recently got it all working perfect and took it on two rides to make sure everything work right. It also needs a new set of Magura MArta brake pads, which are $25 online or ordered through any bie shop. I always rode it with one sintered and one metallic pad at each brake, but there isn’t much of a difference. Pads are super easy to replace, can be done at home yourself.   I don’t understand why more bikes nowadays don’t have lockouts. This bike has front & rear lockouts, with the rear being a remote lever on the handlebar which is so nice for extended climbs.

Great bike for riders 6’-3” to 6’-9” (I’m 6-4). Great in mountains, rolling hills and flats. Great value for someone who doen’t have $5k to shell out for a new 105 or ultegra bike. This one was roughly $8-9k when it was new with top of the line parts in great condition and still rides great.  Background:  I worked in bike shops from 1999 through 2007 off and on and rode quite a bit until 2013 or so, then have ridden extremely little in the past 9 years or so, 6 years due to children, and the three previous years due to renovating an 100 year old house myself in addition to having a new grown-up job I needed to dedicate a lot of time to.  Without my full History, I had a Cannondale CADD 7 60 cm in about 2001/2 which I rode for 1-2 years and really liked how stiff it was for being a taller rider. I swapped out for a 63 SM Team Edition Cadd-8 a couple years later, and appreciated the stiffer BB30 Bottom bracket and SI crank along with a,little more reach, as I preferred to do longer group rides rather than crits and sprints. In 2009 I had the opportunity to by this bike, a couple years used, which I did from a older gentleman in northern VA, who had bought the bike in Florida and mostly rode it on his trainer in the garage. I swapped over most of my parts, the ones currently on the bike, and sold off the 10 spd ultegra group-set and heavier carbon SI crank he had on it.  I’ve ridden it a few thousand miles, on back country roads around Washington DC and one 150 mile ride in Washington State, but mostly got out of riding.  I recently moved to Santa Barbara CA, and have been riding it more, however realized that, being significantly older, heavier, and having very long steep mountains, I’d better off getting a endurance bike to ride on, so this one gets sold.  Description of bike Parts: Yes, this is the same team edition top-of-the-line frame that was raced in all the major tours in 2005 by team Lampre-Caffita. Why more bike teams aren’t sponsored by coffee companies, I’ll never know.  The BB30 press-fit BB is supper stiff, so a couple years later all other brands started licensing and/or copying this, and now it is on most every decent bike. The SI aluminum crank is super light and super stiff, even by today's standards.  A compact spider can easily be had for $90, and new rings for another $100 if you want to convert to that.  The wheels are again, top of the line, and with a slight variation, are still being sold today for over $1k. The bearings are solid and smooth, the freehub-body recently got re-lubed and service, and the rims have screw-in grommets, which are a pain to build, but make this one of the first tubeless compatible rims. The wheels are light, under 1600 grams, and supper strong with the bladder aluminum spokes, great climbing or flat wheels and are super straight. ONe thing we saw often in our shop was people not cleaning their pads and gauging the sidewalls of the rims, scraping off aluminum and making a concave surface.  I rarely brake hard, and the surface of these are completely flat. There is no signs of wear on them, still in superb condition.  The FSA K-wing bar is so comfortable, this upgrade made the front end significantly better bump absorption and to this day is a great bar. It is strong, stiff and absorptive, with extremely comfortable flat top section and a flattened space right behind the hoods which is really comfortable. The K-wing does have a little top-coat that has come off, but you can barely see it and it is still 100% functionally sound.  I think also that the 9 spd Dura-Ace levers are the most comfortable levers made, except maybe the mid 200’s campy stuff, and is the reason why I never upgraded to 10 or 11 spd shimano, as the hoods grew to be huge and not as comfortable to me, and provided little functional difference. They still  brake and shift perfect, albeit with a few scratches on the levers from leaning the bike against walls over the years.  The Mavic Brakes were only made for a couple years, and are the lightest and strongest ones out there, using Shimano pads.  I am convinced that road bike brakes other than the big 3 never make it because top teams can’t run them without loosing the top-3 sponsorship, thus, even if a bit better, they aren’t used.  Stem is Thompson road, great combination of strong, durable and light, 2-bolt road stem (oversized).   Wear: I will try and explain the wear to the best of my ability, and have included a plethora of picts so you can see for yourself, but everything works perfect unless noted hear. Let me know if you have a question or want a different picture.  First I want to explain what I am sure is most of your concern, the bubbling/corrosion at a couple of the bonded carbon/aluminum areas. This was present when I bought the bike and supposedly came from excessive use in a garage on a trainer without wiping the bike down and sweat causing a galvanic reaction.  I have had three cannondale rep’s look at this, and each said that it shouldn’t be a problem unless a cable stop comes off or it gets really bad. If a cable stop does pop-off, a add-on one with a clamp could be used.  I have cleaned this after most every ride and have seen no change in this bubbling for the 13 years I have owned the bike. That being said, I sell this just as I bought it, with no guarantee about it. Feel free to google six13 galvanic corrosion, and read about this. From what I can tell, this has been mainly a cosmetic problem only. Handlebar tape end tape is coming off and need new electrical tape. I just opened up my tool box and found my old electrical tape trashed from age, so you’ll have to fix this.  The saddle has…age, it is faded somewhat, and has a few scuffs, but no rips. I love the airione, and the color matches this bike perfectly. You can replace with your own saddle if you want, I can remove for a $15 reduction in cost. Tires are fairly new, but have some cuts in them, so they need replacing. I have a extra pair of nice riding Vittoria diamante Pro 23 mm, but they are yellow, and you might not like that, or you may want to put on 25 mm tires. I will include the Vittoria's in case you want to use them. The chain, chainrings and cassette have some wear on them, but are not ready to replace yet. If you do go to compact chain-rings, I’d replace the cassette and chain also, a ultra 12-25 cassette and chain are about $100 online. As previously mentioned, the wheels have been ridden probably 3k, but are in excellent shape and never trashed or crashed.  Ride: The CADD-6,7,8 Cannondale frames are stiff and well, made with all american welds and light oversized tubing. These bikes are especially great for taller riders, where there is a bit more give in the rear chain stays due to the longer length, especially with the CADD-8 which had flattened states to give vertical compliance while maintaining horizontal stiffness. The six/13 is essentially a CADD-8, with carbon inserts for the down, top and seat tubes. This gives more front end and seat compliance, with a little bit of a weight gain.  I believe this to also alleviate stress to the aluminum welds.  Regardless, the ride of this for a 63 cm bike is amazing.  Super lively out of the saddle, responsive light and comfortable.  I left some steer tube, so you can raise the handlebars a bit if you want.  I truly love the way this rides, even today compared to most other road bikes. I would recommend  putting 25 mm tires on it, which should clear fine, not sure about 28’s, but the 25’s would give a bit more comfort.  Extra’s: I will include the following items in addition to what is listed/shown:  2x Vittoria diamante Pro 23 mm Gold color new in box  -1x set op Dura-Ace brake pads. Rear brake pads on bike are near end of life  -1 lightly used dura-ace 9 spd rear derailleur I had laying around.  -Flight Deck owner manual  -I'd be happy to add the ultra pedals for an extra $25  Sale details: For sale locally and a online, feel free to contact me with questions are to set up a local test ride.

Here is a glimpse at just the top ten uses of utility trailers:  1.Automobiles: From time to time it becomes necessary to haul an inoperable car or truck. Tow trucks are expensive, especially if the distance is great. A utility trailer is a great way to haul vehicles and a good investment if you need to do so regularly.  2.Boats: If you have a boat, you will need a utility trailer to get it to and from the water.  3.Lawn Care Equipment: If you live in a rural area, you may find that you need to haul your mowing equipment from one piece of your property to another. Packing equipment and loading it into a pickup truck bed can get old very quickly. A utility trailer will allow you to drive your equipment right up onto the trailer without the aid of ramps or two strong men.  4.Furniture: Moving furniture is a breeze with a utility trailer. Furniture dollies roll right up onto the trailer and you can haul more than you can with a pickup.  5.Building Supplies: Do you have projects that need to be done around the house? Pick up your own building supplies and save on delivery fees.  6.Bikes, Motorcycles, and ATVs: Recreational vehicles are best hauled on a utility trailer.  7.Livestock: An enclosed utility trailer is most often used to haul livestock.  8.Auction and Flea Markets: If you frequent auctions and flea markets, you will need the hauling capability to bring home your inexpensive and rare finds.  9.Appliances: Utility trailers are ideal for hauling appliances.  10.Debris and Trash: Loading trash in and out of your pickup bed can be cumbersome and clean up can be messy, but it would be worse to have to haul trash in your SUV. Clean up after a big job is a lot easier with a utility trailer.  As you can see, there are many reasons why an investment in a utility trailer is a smart move. I'm sure that with a little time, and its easy availability, you will come up with even more ways to use a trailer  ATV UTV SXS MOTORCYCLE BIKE TRANSPORT HAUL MOVE CAR TRUCK MOVING TRAVELING STORAGE CARGO LOADS AUTHORITY BOAT HAULING BUSINESS BUSINESS FOR SALE JOB SALES CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT STEEL RAZOR SNOWMOBILE POLARIS YAHAMA WILD CAT MACHINE AUTOMOBILE AUTO VAN TOWING TOW VECHICLE SNOW RAIN BOX TRUCK FLATBED GOOSNECK BUMPER PULL HITCH BALL WEATHER BUY WOOD Westchester County, NY Amawalk, Annsville, Archville, Ardsley, Ardsley-on-Hudson, Armawalk, Armonk, Arthur Manor, Banksville, Bayberry Park, Bedford, Bedford Center, Bedford Hills, Beech Hill, Beechmont, Beechmont Woods, Bonnie Crest, Boutonville, Briarcliff Manor, Bronxville, Bronxville Heights, Bryn Mawr Park, Buchanan, Buckhout Corners, Butlerville, Cecil Park, Cedar Knolls, Chappaqua, Chauncey, Chester Hill Park, Chimney Corners, Colonial Acres, Colonial Heights, Crestwood, Crestwood Gardens, Crompond, Cross River, Croton Falls, Croton Heights, Croton-on-Hudson, Crotonville, Crugers, Dobbs Ferry, Dunwoodie, Dunwoodie Heights, East Irvington, East White Plains, East Woods, Eastchester, Eastview, Elmsford, Elmsmere, Fairview, Fleetwood, Forest Knolls, Fox Meadow, Furnace Woods, Gallows Hill, Glendale, Glenville, Glenwood, Goldens Bridge, Graham, Granite Springs, Grant Corner, Greenhaven, Greenville, Grey Oaks, Greystone, Gunther Park, Harrison, Hartsdale, Hastings-on-Hudson, Hawthorne, Heath Ridge, Heathcote, Heritage Hills, Homestead Park, Horseshoe Hill, Horton Estates, Huguenot Park, Irvington, Isle of San Souci, Jefferson Valley, Katonah, Kitchawan, Lake Katonah, Lake Lincolndale, Lake Mohegan, Lake Purdy, Larchmont, Lawrence Park, Lewisboro, Lincoln, Lincolndale, Lowerre, Ludlow, Mamaroneck, Maplewood, Mariandale, Millwood, Milton, Mohegan Heights, Mohegan Lake, Montrose, Mount Airy, Mount Hope, Mount Kisco, Mount Pleasant, Mount Vernon, Murdock Woods, Murray Hill, Nepera Park, Nepperhan, New Rochelle, North Salem, North White Plains, Oceola Lake, Orienta, Oscawana, Ossining, Park Hill, Parkside, Peekskill, Pelham, Pelham Manor, Philipse Manor, Pinebrook, Pinebrook Heights, Pleasantside, Pleasantville, Pocantico Hills, Port Chester, Pound Ridge, Purchase, Purdys, Purdys Grove, Quaker Ridge, Quarry Heights, Residence Park, Ridgeway, Rochelle Heights, Rochelle Park, Roe Park, Rosedale, Rye, Rye Brook, Salem Center, Sarles Corners, Scarborough, Scarsdale, Scarsdale Downs, Scarsdale Park, Scotts Corners, Secor Gardens, Shenorock, Sherman Park, Shore Acres, Shrub Oak, Sleepy Hollow, Sleepy Hollow Manor, Somers, South Salem, Sparta, Spring Valley, Stanwood, Sun Haven, Sunny Brae, Tarrytown, Thornwood, Toddville, Tompkins Corners, Tuckahoe, Twin Lakes Village, Valhalla, Valley Pond Estates, Van Cortlandtville, Vernon Park, Verplanck, Victory Park, Vista, Waccabuc, Waverly, West Mount Vernon, White Birches, White Plains, Whitehall Corners, Wilmot Woods, Windmill Farm, Woodlands, Woodybrook, Worthington, Wykagyl, Wykagyl Park, Yonkers, Yorktown, Yorktown Heights, brooklyn, queens, manhattan, nyc, bronx, staten island, long island, hudson valley",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My trusty bonneville is making a rattling sound, occurring in 2nd gear only. Both Tom (BBC Triumph in Ventura) and Dan (Precision motorcycles in Goleta) think it's a gearbox issue. The bike currently runs fine if you skip 2nd gear, but to fix it this means dropping the engine and opening it up, which is an expensive job if done at a shop. I am considering it doing it myself but I really don't have a lot of space for the job, plus I own other bikes already, so if I find someone interested in buying it off me it might be the easier way to do it.   The bike is, issue aside, in overall good conditions, it runs, title in hand, regularly registered in CA, belongs to me. I have been riding it regularly as my daily driver since 2017 when I bought it with 10k miles, now has 36k. It's lived in so you will find aesthetic imperfections and scratches here and there, but I took great care of it where it counts. It has plenty of life in it, so if someone is willing to fix the gear issue (or swap the engine if you are into that)  they'll own a great bike with a ton of character.  Jobs and parts: - regular oil and filter changes (every 3k) - air filter cleaning (every 6k) - new spark plugs (Jan 2022) - new barnetts clutch with green springs (Jan 2022) - new rear brake rotor (2021) - rebuilt both calipers (2021) - spiegler braided brake lines - new sprockets and chain  - new wheel bearings (Jan 2022) - new EBC sintered brake pads (Jan 2022) - progressive fork springs (2019) - Hagon road shocks (2019) - new Avon roadriders mkIII tires (Jan 2022)  Also comes with triumph saddlebags and luggage racks, and a bunch of beauty mods that just make the bike look a little nicer: triumph king and queen seat, metal turn signals with LEDs, new headlight bracket, ignition key bracket, rear caliper relocation bracket, adjustable brake and clutch levers, metal shift peg, radiator guard, rectifier guard, renthal handlebar, kuryakin helmet lock. Comes with all original parts as well if you really want to.  I understand this is an atypical situation so I will be very happy to discuss details over the phone or in person to make sure everything is clear.",,,, salvage,,,, Triumph, Bonneville,,,,,,

The new Streetfighter V4 SP is the most adrenaline-pumping naked bike to ever roll its wheels off the production line in Borgo Panigale.Aesthetically, the SP stands out from the pack thanks to its “Winter Test” livery, which Centro Stile Ducati created by taking inspiration from the bikes used during MotoGP and SBK pre-season testing.The new carbon rims, 3 lb lighter than those of the Streetfighter V4 S, significantly reduce the moment of inertia and contribute to an overall weight saving of 6.6 lb. The 1103 cc Desmosedici Stradale engine features a counter-rotating crankshaft, “Twin Pulse” firing order, 208 HP of power and 90.4 lb-ft @ 11,500 rpm. The STM-EVO SBK dry clutch ensures a more effective anti-hopping function but also reproduces the characteristic sound that Ducatisti so appreciate. The comprehensive range of equipment is completed with Ohlins Smart EC 2.0 suspension and the Brembo Stylema R® braking system with front calipers.Features may include:CHASSISCarbon Fiber Wheels5 split spokes premium-quality wheels are made of high-strength carbon fiber and feature aluminum hubs screwed to the composite structure. Both allow a weight saving of 3 lb compared to the forged aluminium wheels of the Streetfighter V4 S; moreover this figure is further improved with 7.5 lb less. The result? A significant reduction of moment of inertia, which provide for an increased agility and lightness when changing direction.Braking systemThe braking system consists of two 330 mm diameter Brembo discs at the front combined with new Brembo Stylema® R monobloc calipers, featuring racing-derived pistons equipped with ventilation holes, which improve the stability of the lever stroke even after numerous laps on the racetrack and further reduce the residual torque.ENGINEDesmosedici StradaleThe Streetfighter V4 SP is powered by the 1,103 cm³ Desmosedici Stradale, : 90°-V4 layout engine with Desmodromic distribution MotoGP-derived, featuring rare gems as the counter-rotating crankshaft and “Twin Pulse” firing order. The engine delivers 208 hp at 13,000 rpm and a torque of 90.7 lb-ft at 9,500 rpm.Dry clutchThe 90°-V4 layout engine features a 9-disc STM EVO-SBK dry clutch, made of machined aluminum. Compared to the wet clutch of the Streetfighter V4 S, in the extreme use on the track, the dry clutch guarantees a more effective anti-hopping function, even in the most aggressive downshifts, and greater fluidity in all phases of “off-throttle”. The assembly of the open clutch cover made of carbon fiber, included in the kit, gives the classic metallic sound which appealed to thousands of Ducatisti.Des$795 Please call For ADMWheels in Motion9710 De Soto AveChatsworth, CA 91311Ask for: Sales TeamPrimary Phone: (866) 842-7080Text with any questions 747-205-4007 WE WILL NOT BE UNDERSOLD.

Here is a glimpse at just the top ten uses of utility trailers:  1.Automobiles: From time to time it becomes necessary to haul an inoperable car or truck. Tow trucks are expensive, especially if the distance is great. A utility trailer is a great way to haul vehicles and a good investment if you need to do so regularly.  2.Boats: If you have a boat, you will need a utility trailer to get it to and from the water.  3.Lawn Care Equipment: If you live in a rural area, you may find that you need to haul your mowing equipment from one piece of your property to another. Packing equipment and loading it into a pickup truck bed can get old very quickly. A utility trailer will allow you to drive your equipment right up onto the trailer without the aid of ramps or two strong men.  4.Furniture: Moving furniture is a breeze with a utility trailer. Furniture dollies roll right up onto the trailer and you can haul more than you can with a pickup.  5.Building Supplies: Do you have projects that need to be done around the house? Pick up your own building supplies and save on delivery fees.  6.Bikes, Motorcycles, and ATVs: Recreational vehicles are best hauled on a utility trailer.  7.Livestock: An enclosed utility trailer is most often used to haul livestock.  8.Auction and Flea Markets: If you frequent auctions and flea markets, you will need the hauling capability to bring home your inexpensive and rare finds.  9.Appliances: Utility trailers are ideal for hauling appliances.  10.Debris and Trash: Loading trash in and out of your pickup bed can be cumbersome and clean up can be messy, but it would be worse to have to haul trash in your SUV. Clean up after a big job is a lot easier with a utility trailer.  As you can see, there are many reasons why an investment in a utility trailer is a smart move. I'm sure that with a little time, and its easy availability, you will come up with even more ways to use a trailer  ATV UTV SXS MOTORCYCLE BIKE TRANSPORT HAUL MOVE CAR TRUCK MOVING TRAVELING STORAGE CARGO LOADS AUTHORITY BOAT HAULING BUSINESS BUSINESS FOR SALE JOB SALES CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT STEEL RAZOR SNOWMOBILE POLARIS YAHAMA WILD CAT MACHINE AUTOMOBILE AUTO VAN TOWING TOW VECHICLE SNOW RAIN BOX TRUCK FLATBED GOOSNECK BUMPER PULL HITCH BALL WEATHER BUY WOOD Westchester County, NY Amawalk, Annsville, Archville, Ardsley, Ardsley-on-Hudson, Armawalk, Armonk, Arthur Manor, Banksville, Bayberry Park, Bedford, Bedford Center, Bedford Hills, Beech Hill, Beechmont, Beechmont Woods, Bonnie Crest, Boutonville, Briarcliff Manor, Bronxville, Bronxville Heights, Bryn Mawr Park, Buchanan, Buckhout Corners, Butlerville, Cecil Park, Cedar Knolls, Chappaqua, Chauncey, Chester Hill Park, Chimney Corners, Colonial Acres, Colonial Heights, Crestwood, Crestwood Gardens, Crompond, Cross River, Croton Falls, Croton Heights, Croton-on-Hudson, Crotonville, Crugers, Dobbs Ferry, Dunwoodie, Dunwoodie Heights, East Irvington, East White Plains, East Woods, Eastchester, Eastview, Elmsford, Elmsmere, Fairview, Fleetwood, Forest Knolls, Fox Meadow, Furnace Woods, Gallows Hill, Glendale, Glenville, Glenwood, Goldens Bridge, Graham, Granite Springs, Grant Corner, Greenhaven, Greenville, Grey Oaks, Greystone, Gunther Park, Harrison, Hartsdale, Hastings-on-Hudson, Hawthorne, Heath Ridge, Heathcote, Heritage Hills, Homestead Park, Horseshoe Hill, Horton Estates, Huguenot Park, Irvington, Isle of San Souci, Jefferson Valley, Katonah, Kitchawan, Lake Katonah, Lake Lincolndale, Lake Mohegan, Lake Purdy, Larchmont, Lawrence Park, Lewisboro, Lincoln, Lincolndale, Lowerre, Ludlow, Mamaroneck, Maplewood, Mariandale, Millwood, Milton, Mohegan Heights, Mohegan Lake, Montrose, Mount Airy, Mount Hope, Mount Kisco, Mount Pleasant, Mount Vernon, Murdock Woods, Murray Hill, Nepera Park, Nepperhan, New Rochelle, North Salem, North White Plains, Oceola Lake, Orienta, Oscawana, Ossining, Park Hill, Parkside, Peekskill, Pelham, Pelham Manor, Philipse Manor, Pinebrook, Pinebrook Heights, Pleasantside, Pleasantville, Pocantico Hills, Port Chester, Pound Ridge, Purchase, Purdys, Purdys Grove, Quaker Ridge, Quarry Heights, Residence Park, Ridgeway, Rochelle Heights, Rochelle Park, Roe Park, Rosedale, Rye, Rye Brook, Salem Center, Sarles Corners, Scarborough, Scarsdale, Scarsdale Downs, Scarsdale Park, Scotts Corners, Secor Gardens, Shenorock, Sherman Park, Shore Acres, Shrub Oak, Sleepy Hollow, Sleepy Hollow Manor, Somers, South Salem, Sparta, Spring Valley, Stanwood, Sun Haven, Sunny Brae, Tarrytown, Thornwood, Toddville, Tompkins Corners, Tuckahoe, Twin Lakes Village, Valhalla, Valley Pond Estates, Van Cortlandtville, Vernon Park, Verplanck, Victory Park, Vista, Waccabuc, Waverly, West Mount Vernon, White Birches, White Plains, Whitehall Corners, Wilmot Woods, Windmill Farm, Woodlands, Woodybrook, Worthington, Wykagyl, Wykagyl Park, Yonkers, Yorktown, Yorktown Heights, brooklyn, queens, manhattan, nyc, bronx, staten island, long island, hudson valley",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I started rehab on it by cleaning and rebuilding the carbs with stay up floats and gaskets. I have since replaced all fluids (oil + filter, gearbox, brake) and any gaskets I found producing a weep. It now starts and runs well. I've also adjusted the clutch.  The T150 is a 5 speed model with a disc front brake & proper British right side shift. This one has a trispark electronic ignition installed. Many spares are included with plenty of brand new odds and ends which came with it or I've since purchased, nearly a full engine rebuild gasket kit. I'm also including a Chris Knight belt drive conversion kit valued at a few hundred. This is nice longevity insurance as the standard primary drive chains are no longer available.  It’s ready for a more appropriate battery (such as a Motobatt MB9U) and tires of your choosing to make it a rider, along with carb fiddling that comes with owning a classic British bike. The tank looks to be in good condition aside from failed liner which I’ve cleaned up. The horn and rear turn signals do not currently work - through the front are flashing properly via relay so they may just need a connector reseated in the harness.  It has a clean title and reportedly has been on non op registration. Title states a 1972 but experts on these bikes identify it as a manufacturer year '75.  Old British iron is only going up in value. I got this bike as part of a package deal and have been looking forward to refreshing & enjoying it as part of starting a classic collection, but I'm now looking to downsize and have a lack of time to see this through. It is rare to see a trident in this condition, with a little time spent it will clean up exceptionally well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I used it regularly to commute and for getting around SB congestion (park anywhere). Some great features of this bike are the simple and straight forward controls, and the TRUNK! Bring a change of cloths, a picnic, a spare helmet for your inevitable passenger. You'll never go back to another bike after experiencing the practicality of the pc800. Paint and plastic are in great shape for 28 years of age (hard to come by on these bikes)   Recent maintenance  Synthetic oil change  Oil filter  Airfilter  Rebuilt clutch master and slave cylinder and new hard line (buttery smooth feel) Cleaned and synced carbs (very smooth for a vtwin)  All around great turn key bike  $4000",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
