Contoured for three passengers, the center seat is positioned up and forward to maximize space and comfort, and the covering is designed to resist both the elements and heavy use.LCD INSTRUMENT DISPLAY: Completely redesigned for 2022, the instrument display is much easier to read, with big, bright new graphics. The display now includes a clutch indicator and a battery-voltage readout too, in addition to speed, fuel level, RPM, transmission mode, water temperature, trip information and more.REAR-VIEW MIRROR: All our new 2022 Pioneer 1000 models feature an integral rear-view mirror mounting bracket on the rollover protection structure. The mirror itself is standard equipment on the Pioneer 1000 Trail, and an available accessory on all other trims.SOPHISTICATED CHASSIS: Some of the most impressive Pioneer 1000 features are those you’ll never see. In addition to the suspension and ground clearance, we rubber-mounted the engine and exhaust system to insulate the cabin against excessive vibration. So while you may not see this feature, it’s one you will definitely notice.TILT WHEEL: With a tilt steering wheel redesigned for 2022 to make getting in and out easier than ever, you’re ensured an even more comfortable driving experience. We’ve given the wheel a wide range of adjustments for optimum customization and a new spring-loaded damper that makes tilting it a snap.COOLER CABIN: Our engineers have given the whole Pioneer 1000 lineup some big improvements when it comes to managing cabin heat. You’ll ride cooler and be more comfortable in warm-weather conditions.ENGINEERINGi-4WD: The Pioneer 1000 Trail showcase our exclusive i-4WD system. Think “I” for “Intelligent,” because that’s exactly what it is. An industry-first brake-traction control system for side-by-sides, it simplifies operation, increases drivability and optimizes traction. Using proven, advanced technology from the Honda automotive division, you get the benefits associated with a locked front differential with none of the downsides. That means it maintains front-wheel traction even if one wheel wants to spin on ice or mud or if it’s in a hole. But at the same time, you get the lighter steering, better tracking at high speeds, tighter turning radius, and reduced kickback associated with unlocked front differentials.ADVANCED TRANSMISSION LOGIC: The brain of the DCT, Advanced Transmission Logic, senses how you drive and adapts. Relaxed drivers get earlier shifts for a quieter ride at lower engine speeds. Sportier drivers will hold each gear longer for higher RPM shifts. And when going downhill, you get true engine braking. Now that’s a smart transmission.REDESIGNED PARKING INTERLOCK: Even something like the parking brake is better on the 2022 Pioneer 1000. We’ve taken the old three-cable design and replaced it with one push/pull cable that makes adjusting easier and cuts down on servicing.HANDLINGCHASSIS AND SUSPENSION: Prepare to go further than ever before. Our refined chassis enables you to tackle terrain others would shy away from, with larger tires, long-travel independent front and rear suspension and huge ground clearance. The rubber mounted engine and exhaust system insulates against excessive vibration.OTR DIRT MASTER: All our Pioneer 1000 models for 2022 feature high-performance OTR Dirt Master tires for excellent off-road traction and superior wear.THREE DIFFERENT WHEEL CHOICES: Our four Pioneer 1000 models come with three different wheel choices. The Pioneer 1000 Trail Edition gets 14-inch black aluminum wheels with contrast-cut highlights.EPS SYSTEM: This is something we’re really proud of. Honda pioneered (no pun intended) electric power steering on our side by sides, and now we’re making it better. Every 222 Pioneer 1000 gets a new EPS system with a new, brushless motor integrated with the ECU. The return-to-center function makes it more intuitive on straight trails, and the whole system feels more linear.INDEPENDENT FRONT AND REAR SUSPENSION: Dual A-arm suspension gives you 10.5 inches of travel in the front, and 10-inches of travel in the rear. Pair that with stellar ground clearance, and you maximize available traction and superior comfort maneuvering over terrain other side-by-sides would shy away from.PADDLE SHIFTING: Steering column-mounted paddle shifters add a serious dose of performance in every drive. In Manual mode, they let you shift without ever taking your hands off the wheel, and in Automatic mode, they let you override the current gear with a quick up or downshift, holding that gear for several seconds before returning to Automatic mode.TURF/2WD/4WD/DIFF LOCK: Don’t tear up sensitive surfaces. Select Turf Mode. Want to access as much traction as possible? Put it in 4WD. Need maximum power at all four wheels? Lock the front and rear differentials. And the best part is, you can do it all with a shift of a single lever.PERFORMANCEMORE POWERFUL 999cc TWIN-CYLINDER ENGINE: We’ve boosted the engine power in our entire Pioneer 1000 lineup, especially in the midrange and top end. The improved acceleration and overall performance is noticeable, magnified by this year’s new lower gear ratios. Using the same Unicam® cylinder head design found in our motocross bikes, the class-leading 999cc liquid-cooled inline twin is more compact, and it still delivers the kind of horsepower and torque you’d expect from a flagship model.2500-POUND TOWING CAPACITY: Have a big load to haul? Great news for 2022—we've increased the Pioneer 1000's towing capacity to 2500 pounds. So now instead of hopping on the tractor or taking out the truck, you can stay right in your side-by-side and tackle those bigger jobs with relative ease.BUILT IN THE U.S.A.: The Pioneer 1000 is purpose-built for the American market, right in America. Domestically and globally sourced parts are all assembled at our plant in Timmonsville, South Carolina, and once these side-by-sides roll off the line, they’re ready to explore every corner of the country.FULLY-AUTOMATIC SIX-SPEED DCT TRANSMISSION: Drive the way you want, with the industry’s first and only all gear six-speed Dual Clutch Transmission. Choose between manual mode or fully automatic. Plus, the addition of Sport Mode increases the fun, shifting at higher RPM for a spirited, full-performance driving experience.HIGH/LOW SUBTRANSMISSION: With a full 42-percent gear reduction between High and Low, you get the torque you need in all six gears. It comes in handy when driving over difficult terrain, scaling steep hills or towing heavy loads.GEAR RATIOS: For 2022, all Pioneer 1000 models get new gear ratios in the transmission, subtransmission, and final drive. They help improve your Pioneer’s versatility under all driving conditions.SAFETYSAFETY NETS: We’ve upgraded the safety nets on all our Pioneer 1000 models to connect and disconnect more easily, just like on our Talon sport SxS models. We’ve changed the mesh pattern too.DRIVER/PASSENGER PROTECTION: The Occupant Protection Structure uses large-diameter tubing, and meets ISO’s rollover protection standard. The hard doors and roll-up side nets help keep debris from entering the cabin, and auto-style three-point seatbelts are equipped with an emergency locking retractor mechanism, to help optimize passenger security. When you put this much safety first, fun is sure to follow.FOUR-WHEEL DISC BRAKES: The Pioneer’s uncompromising power helps take you further than ever before. The reliable disc brakes help you stop on a dime. Built to the same standard as you’d find in our autos, the four-wheel disc brakes minimize debris from building up, ensuring consistent performance, and giving you confidence on the trail.VERSATILITYNEW FOREST AND TRAIL MODELS: New for 2022, we’re happy to announce two new Pioneer 1000 models: our Trail and Forest versions. They’re loaded with factory-installed accessories and extras, like Warn winches, special wheels, cabin lighting, special paint and graphics, and much more.1000-POUND-CAPACITY TILT BED: There are a ton of reasons to buy a Pioneer 1000. Among them: the half-ton hauling capacity*. And when it comes to dumping, we’ve made it easier than ever, with a hydraulic assist tilt bed lever that can be accessed from outside the vehicle, or right from the driver’s seat. *600-pound bed capacity for CA modelsMORE UNDERSEAT STORAGE: The Pioneer 1000’s underseat storage area is much improved for 2022. We’ve made the opening larger, which makes getting objects in and out a lot easier.BIGGER CUPHOLDERS: You asked, we listened. The primary dash-mounted cupholders in our 2022 Pioneer 1000 models are upsized this year, and big enough to hold the most popular insulated tumblers. Plus, all Pioneer 1000 models also feature cup holders in every door. Designed to hold your water bottles securely, it’s a convenient touch everyone will appreciate.UNDER-DASH STORAGE: Standard equipment on the Pioneer 1000 Trail, and as an available accessory on the Pioneer 1000, this practical under-dash shelf keeps frequently used items right up front in the cab.WARN VRX 45 WINCH: This is a huge upgrade and standard equipment on our Pioneer 1000 Trail models. The winch is installed at the factory, and is built right into the Pioneer’s chassis, not added on as an accessory. With a 4500-pound capacity and spooled with steel cable, you’ll be ready to pull your buddy out when he gets stuck!ACCESSORY SWITCH PANEL: Standard equipment on the 2022 Pioneer 1000 Trail, the switch panel has room for seven switches, letting you control things like a winch, accessory lights, and more. A fully integrated design, it sits in the center of the dashboard, underneath the other switches and controls.12-VOLT ACCESSORY SOCKET: The Pioneer 1000 Trail all feature a standard 12-volt power socket in the bed. Using a common “cigarette-lighter” style of outlet, it’s perfect for powering things like a spotlight, work light, sprayer, air compressor, 110-volt inverter and more.INTERIOR LIGHT: Our new 2022 Pioneer 1000 Trail come with an interior light that lights up the floor area of the cabin., It’s convenient, and a big help illuminating the under-dash storage area so you can find your items in low-light conditions.ENGINE AIR INTAKE: To get the most out of your engine, you need the best air going into it. That’s why we positioned the air intake up high under the hood. It helps ensure a clean air supply, even at deeper fording depths, and with a viscous air filter element, you get increased performance and longer service intervals.Call California Custom Trailers & Powersports at (805) 227-46652340 PROSPECT AVE, STE 105, PASO ROBLES, CA 93446  Or online at www.calcustompaso.com (MSRP = Manufacture Suggested Retail Price and does not Include Factory Freight, Documentation, DMV, Ca Tire Recycling, and Sales Tax)Current Financing available with little to no down payment OAC.  Honda Pioneer, pioneer, 4x4, sxs, side by side, utility",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Someone should open up a dirt bike wrecking yard in their backyard like the guy in the bay area should do. I won't mention his name, but he wants to sell whole parts bikes at ridiculously high prices! I've sold him 2 parts bikes at just $100 each!  At the time, I didn't know about E B A Y, as I could of found the ancient parts needed for these bikes and could of seen if they were running bikes! Oh, them days are long gone!   I think I should hold the record for the most longest, boring Craigslist ad ever to be posted in the world !!!!  Who agrees with me ?  IF I WERE TO GET LIKE 20 PEOPLE ALL WANTING the expensive  PARTS,  all at once, THIS BUILD WOULD BE PARTED OUT!   Just added up the total spent, with the 2 parts NOT in the parts listing, total came to $4400.00 and I have it listed at just $2,000!! Crap! I could of purchased a running bike on C R A I G S L I S T at that price! Darn Madera nurse! I wish I would of have not listen to her when she told me to put my mind to work and do something I enjoy doing!!!!   Low on funds, so the reason why I cannot finish this project, buy the coolant, oil up the air filter, change the motor oil, get the gas and pre-mix oil ETC.      TEXT FIVE-HUNDRED-FIFTY NINE-SEVEN-TEN-FOUR THREE-FOUR-ZERO  if interested in purchasing my build at $2,000 FIRM.  1998 YAMAHA YZ 250 PROJECT!   E B A Y BUILD! Project has  not yet been started by me, needs fluids. All  parts have been purchased from E B A Y and ROCKY MOUNTAIN OEM/ ATV.  I have over the listed price in parts, including shipping, so FIRM on price!  Seller of the frame went and had the frame powder coated after sand blasting it, so the V I N  #  I cannot see! I looked on the internet and there it  said the V I N could be found on the frame under the engine somewhere!  I was like, ""0000PS"" but didn't locate it. But this was after the motor was installed into the frame.  He stated to me that  it is as clear as day to read. I have the sellers name and telephone # , just tried hunting for it, couldn't find it. Good news! I just found it! Strange how on this slip, it states 30 lbs. The motor should weigh more, Im guessing, maybe not!  So should  the frame and SUB frame he shipped to me. Frame and SUB is all metal, not aluminum!  I will probably be the one that will be writing up a Bill of Sale as you will be purchasing this bike from me, not him.  I need this project out of my bedroom ! I will show you on my old cellphone, if it can power up still and I can go back on my E B A Y 's buying  page, but probably not though as the thing broke,  and service is shut off,  so the reason why I took the photos from the old phone with this new one,  all the parts l bought and the total I put into this build to show you I am taking a huge loss on the price! I have the parts written  down and the total, so you're just going to have to believe me. I am disabled from a stroke so my mind and damaged brain is not capable of allowing me to return back to riding dirt bikes safely   anymore, something I have been doing since I was like 4 years old, maybe 5 or 6. just turned  51 on February the 5th.  Lord I'm old !  Text 23 hours a day at FIVE-HUNDRED- FIFTY -NINE-SEVEN-TEN-FOUR -3-FOUR-ZERO if interested. Clutch cable needs to be hooked up, the rear wheel when l tighten down the axle nut, makes the rear wheel not spin OK.  I might have the wheel spacers on the wrong side! I will include the bolt and nut kit I bought to install parts with, but most items on E B A Y, used parts, the seller includes them fasteners as they are parting out their bikes,  and there is really nothing else to add to this build as it is complete. A few pictures show the bike as I was building it, but it will roll under her own parts. Stupid me, what I should of done was snap a photo of the bare frame, and everytime a part was added to it,  take a picture. I  do know the motor went into the frame first, that was a job for this disabled male with a broken arm, well the arm was broken in the dirt bike crash,  during the stroke,  and still it feels as though there is a cast still on it that is squeezing the arm. Also it feels like someone is squeezing my hand right now.  I rolled up 2 towels and placed them across the lower part of the frame , to protect the finish , then placed the motor on the 2 towels, then started to get the engine bolts and top mounting bracket  installed. Dealerships  has their way on which side the bolt goes through the hole and what side they place the nut on. I didn't strip this bike down, so?? Then came the triple clamps,  the old grease was completely wiped off of the steering headset bearings, lots of fresh grease was placed on those bearing roller things, AND I even got a small flat blade screwdriver and gently turned each roller and used the flat blade and forced grease into each cavity. Almost used the whole tube at that location. Also the swingarm bearings, under neath them black dust caps, got a wipe down and grease placed under there, too. I've taken apart a 1985 XR 600 that I had that frame powder coated, and l got to restore that bike my way. Frame was powdercoated white, l found a swingarm on E B A Y that was powder coated the frame's orange color, had blue brand new PRO-LINK decals on it, I did 100% all new plastics, including a brand new tank, tank that cost me $350 from the dealership, sold that build for a cheap $500. Stupid me!""   Then, I can't remember if the forks went on next, or was it the radiators, tank, and shrouds, and I built it that way. Stupid stroke. Also, in building the sub frame, it all had to be disassembled to get all of them fasteners to bolt up. Picture shows it as 1 piece with the airbox, side panels, spark arrestor, ETC The seat was just placed on the sub frame for the photo, installing the sub frame  was a job for this disabled male here with his damaged brain and a non usable arm and hand. . After the motor was mated to the frame, I lifted the frame with motor attached, boy was it already heavy, onto the blue plastic city's recycling bin you see in a few photos. After awhile, that blue bin started to slowly give way,  so I had to get the metal stand, yep, also from E B A Y. What was funny when that stand arrived, I simply just pulled it out of its shipping box, and it was ready for usage. As with me kidding around, I emailed the place that sold the stand to me, saying, "" I'm not particularly fond of my purchased item from you not having to be assembled when I removed  it from its box"" as a joke I sent that message! They gave me like a $8 refund! I was joking with them ! Still, some people like to make their customers  happy! Will I be including the stand upon someone buying this dirt bike from me? Probably not as I have other bikes here at the house that this stand could be used for.  And since this stand can slide easily on carpet, the next bike build will need to be placed on it, whenever that day comes.  Also with the loss I am already taking, no need to be adding  to it.  Will let it go for an additional $60.   Anyways:  The seller of the motor and frame included the foot pegs, just was being a jerk and only sent me 1 foot peg spring,  but I think he went and sabotaged the pegs,  as on the part that your boot touches, them spikes,, all of them spikes around the edge of the pegs,, looks  as though they were all filed down recently, making the tips sharp, so do NOT wear good expensive boots while riding with these foot pegs. Nice aftermarkets can be found on E B A Y, stocks also. Seller was an a$$ hole to me during the bidding process as I asked him to send a Bill of Sale  with the frame,  and any hole on the frame, to insert the correct fastener in it, so that I know something needs to be bolted in that hole. Like where the coil bolts onto, he could of put back the correct bolts in those holes as he included the coil. Also, the top end job  he stated was done, he could of included a receipt.  Dont ask me what all was done as he didn't send any paperwork with this motor. A compression check will need to be done. if this motor is even good, I am taking a huge gamble  on this mystery motor. Still these parts aren't like toilet paper, an item that females use everyday,  and us males, every third day so parting her /  him out would  be a slow process.  Help out a poor disabled  man and take on this  year's summer project, bike is a project. Looks like a dirt bike! The suspension has not yet been tested, so hopefully the fork seals are great and the rear shock isn't blown. Forks were only purchased at a price of just $60, then the $40 for shipping, the sales tax brought it up to the price listed in the parts list. Forks cost me less than the rear shock ????????????????? But then I had to purchase a set of triples!   THANK YOU FOR reading this far!  UPDATE:  I switched the wheel spacers around, rear wheel spins better now! Maybe install a new chain and see what that does?  Wheel bearings? Clutch cable attached! Routed correctly? Questionable! I still need to tighten down the front sprocket, the shift pedal, as well as the kickstarter, as we all like those certain items at a specific spot on them shafts, to get your boot under the shifter, where to correctly place the starter on the shaft,   install the fluids, get some gas and change the blood, ( motor oil)  and keep my fingers crossed the bike fires up! I know the clutch and throttle cables will probably need to be adjusted better, but I'm only a novice in doing stuff like that, l know front brakes work great, and the rear has a low brake pedal, will work,  but you got to really push the pedal to the carpet! Bike has NOT left the bedroom since it was put together, so the tires has only touched the bedroom carpet! OOOOOPS, bike is on its E B A Y bought stand, and the front tire is on a piece of cardboard.  Maybe I'm just a damaged weakling? The brake reservoir is full, I'm an old school guy, all my dirt bikes were rear drum brakes so maybe  this is acceptable? I don't know. I do know on my rear drum brake bikes, my boot would rest on the foot peg, as well as the rear brake pedal, causing it to activate when riding, so what I would do is, back off a little on the rear brake adjustment. Saved on rear brake shoes this way. So maybe the really far down to push the rear brakes to the dirt, is this way of not riding  the rear brakes?? Rear brake assemblies can be found on E B A Y should you need to replace the set up.  Reason for the front fender being black is, with the black powder coated swingarm,  I wanted to go with a blue, black and white appearance as much as possible, so the blue and black seat.  We all know what happens to blue plastics after a crash! Yep! Those white stress marks show up. The rear fender has a white stress dot on it. My father's K L X 1 4 0, yes he is that short of a guy,, had a white rear fender, as well as a green front fender. I know Honda on a XR 600, like the 1988 year,  used a red rear fender and a white front fender. Or vise versa. Also with this bike being assembled in pieces, the blue gas tank doesn't match the blue radiator shrouds, as these parts was purchased from different sellers off of different bikes! Hence, the reason for no tank decals on the tank. I thought about purchasing a black fuel tank, but we all know how hard it is to see the fuel level with black fuel tanks!  Trust me on that. Also black parts are hard to see, so the reason I went with the white radiator guards and the white radiator hoses. You can see them better.  Now I see a white air box on E B A Y. NOPE, too expensive and I am low on funds. I won't be switching out no more parts! This is my build, I built it up my way.   LOL  The rear fender, the radiator shrouds, and the brand new front disc brake guard all share  the same shade of blue. Tank doesn't match these parts! Let's keep that a secret between buyer and builder.   Carb is supposed to be brand spanking new, a E B A Y purchased part, so hopefully no adjustment  there is needed as at the carb, things will need to be removed in order to gain access there! Just hopefully the electrical is OK and the bike fires up one day ! I placed an ad on C R A I G S awhile ago asking if the powder coating under neath where the coil bolts to, do I have to go back and scrape off the paint,, for a better ground,, and so I outlined the coil  and slowly had to scrape away the nice paint job! You will never see it. Seller of the motor and  frame is the same guy. He included the wiring harness, the CDI, the coil, and even had a clean spark plug in the head that looked brand spanking new.  Stupid me forgot to check the # on the spark plug to see if it is correct for this motor, so that is something  you will want to do before actually starting her up, and also, to check the gap. Don't want the top of the piston hitting a too long of a spark plug now!  0UCH! I ran the shifter through the gears and they are  engaging, will operate the kickstarter someday.  Thank you for reading this far, hope I haven't bored you too bad ! But please continue to be bored.   L0L Just please don't send me a bill for wasting your time.  Again, for those that cannot read, I'M NOT TAKING ANYMORE OF A LOSS ON THE PRICE AS I AM DOING AT $2000 ! $1995 WON'T buy the bike! $1999 WON'T even! I was offered $1200 by a person by text message that didn't read the whole ad,  came back with a $1300 for his final offer by text. Yes, any amount over the listed price will be greatly appreciated.  LOL I know if I had this build running and registered, it would probably sell quicker, as it will be an all year long green sticker bike. Buy this bike and part him / her out on E B A Y and make yourself a few bucks! I won't mind.   To help you guys out, prices are what I paid on E B A Y, including shipping, if the seller charged for shipping. Some items were the buy it now feature with free  shipping,  and some were the make offer, but now E B A Y is charging sales tax on auctions, just another way us citizens are getting ripped off in this world. If I remember correctly, I do believe the engine and the motor was the only 2  E B A Y listing that were actual auctions, the others were all buy it nows, and make offers. I'm pretty sure I made offers on all make offer auctions. Some items, I paid too much for. On the frame,, I got it at the starting bid,, as no one else in the world needed a 1998 YZ 250 bare frame last year. The motor, I'm guessing the seller had his  buddies bid up the auction, and when it got around to  what he wanted for it, they all stopped bidding. I think I got it for around $950 then the tax and shipping charges!   Here goes.   PARTS LIST :  MOTOR $$1149.65 FORKS $104.85 REAR SHOCK $81.19 AIR BOX $16.24 CARBURETOR $54.30 new THROTTLE $24.84.   new FRONT FENDER $30.30 REAR FENDER $50.86 SEAT $89.94 R BRAKE LINE HOSE CLAMPS $13.15 those white plastic C ' s holding  rear brake line onto swingarm FRAME and  SUB FRAME     $343.49 TRIPLE CLAMPS $106.59 FORK GUARDS 45.30 RADIATOR HOSES $ 23.80  RADIATOR SHROUDS 54.10 RADIATORS $67.10 3  # PLATES $30.00    # 61 RADIATOR LOUVERS $37.89 FRONT SPROCKET ASSEMBLY $ 18.09 REAR AXLE ASSEMBLY $45.22 FRONT CHAIN GUARD $ 17.94 FUEL / GAS TANK $317.21 FMF HEADER PIPE 301.04  MISC FRAME RUBBER $15.01 what's under the fuel tank FOOT PEG SPRINGS $10.77 AIR BOX MUD FLAP $13.80  THE 3 SPRINGS for  HEADER PIPE $12.99 CHAIN ( MISC ) $39.13 SPARK ARRESTOR $92.00 C D I RUBBER BOOT $ 20.36 MUFFLER BRACKET TOP $ 38.92 Brand new  MUFFLER BRACKET BOTTOM $32.42 Brand new  BRAND NEW GRIPS $7.97 HANDLEBARS $81.18 SHIFT PEDAL $ 19.87 BRAND NEW AIR FILTER $28.15 INTAKE CLAMP $22.90 REAR CHAIN GUARD $41.37 SWING ARM LINKAGE $37.88 FRONT BRAKE DISC GUARD $ 30.78 the new blue piece  SWING ARM $ 144.06 SWING ARM DECALS $17.52 HANDLE BAR PAD $10.83 AIR FILTER HOLD DOWN BOLT $ 8.41  WHEEL SET $423.96 CLUTCH CABLE and  LEVER WITH PERCH $ 29.55 FRONT BRAKE ASSEMBLY $81.19 REAR BRAKE ASSEMBLY $64.84 TRIPLE CLAMPS FRONT BRAKE HOLD DOWN METAL BRACKET $19.12  PLUS 3 ORDERS PLACED AT ROCKY MOUNTAIN  OEM / ATV for bolts, nuts ETC totalling almost $400. I know the rear shock was just $75 with free shipping, the tax brought the price up to the listed amount. I can't believe I paid more for the fuel tank, than I did for the FMF header pipe!   And any remaining parts I forgot,  like the brand new kill  switch, and the fuel tank's breather tube,  I'm not going to post , so firm on price at $2,000. The reason for the #61, those were purchased on E B A Y and that was the number. You may change it to whatever # you prefer. I'm just glad it wasn't # 69 ! Would of made me look like I was the pervert!  L0L In 10 more years , 61 will be my age!   Grips and the air filter are probably the only items that are brand new! 000PS, the seller of the header pipe states the pipe was NEVER used, OH and the carb is supposed to be new, the air box mounted mud flap / guard is brand new, and the throttle plastic and housing are new E B A Y items! Would like for this project to go to someone that will finally get her  to the trail someday! I will use the funds from this sale and start up another project, or maybe not! Need to support my Starbucks addiction! With me not selling this build, maybe I will get the radiator coolant, the gas and oil mixture, oil up the air filter, get her fresh oil and see if my build is a YAAAAA ! or a NAAAAA!  How my dirt bike building hobby began was, a long time ago, on E B A Y there was a 1984 YZ 80 being parted out. I wanted to turn the fuel tank into a unique piggy bank. Cut slots in the top to accept the coins.  You just simply turn the thing upside down after unscrewing the fuel tank cap to get the coins to dump out. Well anyways, the fuel tank was all complete, nice, petcock, mounting brackets, nice stock fuel tank decals ETC,  and sold for a great price! The tank arrived, a light bulb went off in my head, saying to me, I cannot afford to buy a dirtbike outright, why not build it piece by piece? And so the dirt bike building  days began. I felt sorry for the 1 guy selling the 85 YZ 80  frame on E B A Y as it only sold for $10 with free shipping. I built the bike,  a red 85 frame, 84 yellow plastics, a black seat, and a front disc brake set up, where as a stock 85 is supposed to be drums in the front. I bought a 1984 YZ80 from a  high school classmate of mine for just $300. My parents bought me a brand spanking new 1985 YZ80 that was only $1200 off the showroom floor,  or out the door,, and even included a spark arrestor!! Oh the cheap prices way back then ! With the extra parts I was getting with building the 1985, I constructed a YZ 80 with a white frame, so let's call him a 1990. The 85 I was able to get running, the 1990, I wasn't so lucky. And stupid me never attempted to diagnose why that 1 wouldnt start, I started parted it out on C R A I G S L I S T, and got the motor sold on E B A Y as a non running motor! Then came K B F L A T F A C E from E B A Y. I guess it is a parting out place on the east coast. There I bought a 1986 Honda Z50R-D frame, forks, swingarm, exhaust pipe, and handlebars from him. The fenders, seat, rear shocks, and fuel tank were all brand new reproduction parts, the motor and wheels were from a Honda Z50R, just not correct for 1986  as they were supposed to be chrome parts.  I never attempted or tried to get the Honda running, added up what I put  into the build, total came to like $1500. I placed the ad on C R A I G S L I S T, got the bike sold to a gentleman living in Pleasanton! The 1985 that I built, later I saw it reposted on CL, the seat cover was all torn up, ripped, and thrashed, I paid like $25 for the seat on E B A Y. So I can honestly say I built 4 bikes all from E B A Y auctions. Just 3 are, or should be still built.  Hopefully 1 day this YZ 250 sells.  The End, hopefully !  Reason why this ad doesn't make since is, I would go back and add to it, because of the stroke I suffered, I dont remember things right away, and so the reason for the carb being listed as brand new a few times. In staring at the fuel tanks cap new breather tube that just arrived yesterday, Valentine's Day, the hose looks as though it is too long and should be shortened by an inch. Will let the new owner decide on that. It's 3"" from top of fuel cap to bottom of the nice color cap breather part on top of the hose.  OK, the end! Definitely!!",,,,,,,,, YAMAHA, WHY ZEE,, 250 cc,

Because the greater the connection, the more rewarding the ride. And that's why Honda CBR600RR models as good as they are. The high-revving inline-four engine is instantly responsive. The aluminum chassis and premium suspension precisely connect you with the road like nothing else. And only a 600 can give you the light, crisp handling so many sportbike riders find so attractive. New graphics for 2021 keeps the CBR600RR looking fresh, and so does the new Grand Prix Red Tricolor paint scheme. The CBR600RR is the best example of a highly refined breed. Is it for you?

Here is a glimpse at just the top ten uses of utility trailers:  1.Automobiles: From time to time it becomes necessary to haul an inoperable car or truck. Tow trucks are expensive, especially if the distance is great. A utility trailer is a great way to haul vehicles and a good investment if you need to do so regularly.  2.Boats: If you have a boat, you will need a utility trailer to get it to and from the water.  3.Lawn Care Equipment: If you live in a rural area, you may find that you need to haul your mowing equipment from one piece of your property to another. Packing equipment and loading it into a pickup truck bed can get old very quickly. A utility trailer will allow you to drive your equipment right up onto the trailer without the aid of ramps or two strong men.  4.Furniture: Moving furniture is a breeze with a utility trailer. Furniture dollies roll right up onto the trailer and you can haul more than you can with a pickup.  5.Building Supplies: Do you have projects that need to be done around the house? Pick up your own building supplies and save on delivery fees.  6.Bikes, Motorcycles, and ATVs: Recreational vehicles are best hauled on a utility trailer.  7.Livestock: An enclosed utility trailer is most often used to haul livestock.  8.Auction and Flea Markets: If you frequent auctions and flea markets, you will need the hauling capability to bring home your inexpensive and rare finds.  9.Appliances: Utility trailers are ideal for hauling appliances.  10.Debris and Trash: Loading trash in and out of your pickup bed can be cumbersome and clean up can be messy, but it would be worse to have to haul trash in your SUV. Clean up after a big job is a lot easier with a utility trailer.  As you can see, there are many reasons why an investment in a utility trailer is a smart move. I'm sure that with a little time, and its easy availability, you will come up with even more ways to use a trailer  ATV UTV SXS MOTORCYCLE BIKE TRANSPORT HAUL MOVE CAR TRUCK MOVING TRAVELING STORAGE CARGO LOADS AUTHORITY BOAT HAULING BUSINESS BUSINESS FOR SALE JOB SALES CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT STEEL RAZOR SNOWMOBILE POLARIS YAHAMA WILD CAT MACHINE AUTOMOBILE AUTO VAN TOWING TOW VECHICLE SNOW RAIN BOX TRUCK FLATBED GOOSNECK BUMPER PULL HITCH BALL WEATHER BUY WOOD Westchester County, NY Amawalk, Annsville, Archville, Ardsley, Ardsley-on-Hudson, Armawalk, Armonk, Arthur Manor, Banksville, Bayberry Park, Bedford, Bedford Center, Bedford Hills, Beech Hill, Beechmont, Beechmont Woods, Bonnie Crest, Boutonville, Briarcliff Manor, Bronxville, Bronxville Heights, Bryn Mawr Park, Buchanan, Buckhout Corners, Butlerville, Cecil Park, Cedar Knolls, Chappaqua, Chauncey, Chester Hill Park, Chimney Corners, Colonial Acres, Colonial Heights, Crestwood, Crestwood Gardens, Crompond, Cross River, Croton Falls, Croton Heights, Croton-on-Hudson, Crotonville, Crugers, Dobbs Ferry, Dunwoodie, Dunwoodie Heights, East Irvington, East White Plains, East Woods, Eastchester, Eastview, Elmsford, Elmsmere, Fairview, Fleetwood, Forest Knolls, Fox Meadow, Furnace Woods, Gallows Hill, Glendale, Glenville, Glenwood, Goldens Bridge, Graham, Granite Springs, Grant Corner, Greenhaven, Greenville, Grey Oaks, Greystone, Gunther Park, Harrison, Hartsdale, Hastings-on-Hudson, Hawthorne, Heath Ridge, Heathcote, Heritage Hills, Homestead Park, Horseshoe Hill, Horton Estates, Huguenot Park, Irvington, Isle of San Souci, Jefferson Valley, Katonah, Kitchawan, Lake Katonah, Lake Lincolndale, Lake Mohegan, Lake Purdy, Larchmont, Lawrence Park, Lewisboro, Lincoln, Lincolndale, Lowerre, Ludlow, Mamaroneck, Maplewood, Mariandale, Millwood, Milton, Mohegan Heights, Mohegan Lake, Montrose, Mount Airy, Mount Hope, Mount Kisco, Mount Pleasant, Mount Vernon, Murdock Woods, Murray Hill, Nepera Park, Nepperhan, New Rochelle, North Salem, North White Plains, Oceola Lake, Orienta, Oscawana, Ossining, Park Hill, Parkside, Peekskill, Pelham, Pelham Manor, Philipse Manor, Pinebrook, Pinebrook Heights, Pleasantside, Pleasantville, Pocantico Hills, Port Chester, Pound Ridge, Purchase, Purdys, Purdys Grove, Quaker Ridge, Quarry Heights, Residence Park, Ridgeway, Rochelle Heights, Rochelle Park, Roe Park, Rosedale, Rye, Rye Brook, Salem Center, Sarles Corners, Scarborough, Scarsdale, Scarsdale Downs, Scarsdale Park, Scotts Corners, Secor Gardens, Shenorock, Sherman Park, Shore Acres, Shrub Oak, Sleepy Hollow, Sleepy Hollow Manor, Somers, South Salem, Sparta, Spring Valley, Stanwood, Sun Haven, Sunny Brae, Tarrytown, Thornwood, Toddville, Tompkins Corners, Tuckahoe, Twin Lakes Village, Valhalla, Valley Pond Estates, Van Cortlandtville, Vernon Park, Verplanck, Victory Park, Vista, Waccabuc, Waverly, West Mount Vernon, White Birches, White Plains, Whitehall Corners, Wilmot Woods, Windmill Farm, Woodlands, Woodybrook, Worthington, Wykagyl, Wykagyl Park, Yonkers, Yorktown, Yorktown Heights, brooklyn, queens, manhattan, nyc, bronx, staten island, long island, hudson valley",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the days before my stroke, I had 1 of these bikes, but it was set up for a tall person to ride, as it had a fat butt seat, and ape hanger style handle bars. With me being over 6 feet tall, my legs are just too long to be riding this bike! I tried, and boy did I fall down and almost cracked the street! 0K I added that last line for a little humor.  Anyways, you either want this or you don't, I won't complain. I do know the one I bought, I would ride it at my bay area Santa Clara Starbucks parking lot, for like 10 minutes, and when I got off the bike, walking again, my legs felt like jello !  I miss that bike! Anyways,    Text 23 hours a day at FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE SEVEN TEN FOUR 3 4 ZERO if interested. I do know on the CLOWN Bike I used to ride, the cranks would hit the pavement if I were to turn too sharply, can't ride this bike as the handle bars are too short, so ??????????
