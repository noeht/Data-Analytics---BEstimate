Recently rebuilt, about 40 miles on it since. It’s got a 153” track and it’s in perfect shape with new sliders. The sled has aftermarket shocks, A-arms, aftermarket running boards, pipe, can, cooling vents for the clutch, carbon handlebars, new reeds, new TPS, and a few other goodies. Has great potential to be a phenomenal mountain sled, which leads to the bad….. it’s spits and sputters like it’s running on one cylinder, I don’t know what it is, but it doesn’t run off both cylinders, however, this is an intermittent issue, runs off both for the first 10 ish seconds. The second issue is that the gauge cluster doesn’t work, got water in it. Hood is ugly and the lights are out of it, have the lights and two harnesses, but they aren’t installed.   I can text pictures if you want, it’s a sled with potential, shoot me an offer, I’m reasonable, just testing the waters as I’d like a different sled this coming season and this would be a perfect sled for someone to tinker with this summer and have a mountain ripper for a fair bit less than what most are asking for sleds these days. Text or email only please! Open to trades too for other toys, specially dirt bikes that are street legal or any other kind of street legal bike. Vehicles and anything else with a motor will be considered, on or off road.  I also have a set of ice age rails and a complete skid assembly that could possibly be negotiated into the deal. 9zero7-95three-59four0",,,,,,,,,,

It has the same dimensions and specifications as the 70/90-16, 80/80-16, 80/90-16, and 90/80-16 motorcycle tires, and 2.50-16 dirt bike tubes. COMPATIBLE REPLACEMENT INNER TUBES FOR DIRT BIKES, PIT BIKES, AND OFF-ROAD MOTORCYCLE - Several brands and models that are compatible with this size of inner tubes include Honda CRF 80F (front tire), Honda XR 80/XR 80R (front tire), and most motorcycles with standard tires. TR4 STRAIGHT VALVE STEM FOR HIGH TORQUE APPLICATIONS -   Centered with a straight and round stem, the TR4 valve fits most rims with a round valve base. Designed specifically for relatively low psi motorcycle and ATV/UTV tires. As they are secured to the rim with nuts and washers, there is a lesser risk of the valve disappearing down to the rim when pumping air. ENJOY OPTIMUM RIDING COMFORT - Made from natural rubber and butyl blend, these inner tubes have a superior impact and vibration dampening property. And as they are also thicker than average inner tubes in the market, the dampening effect doubles, enabling the inner tubes to work effectively in tandem with the bike’s suspension system to provide you with the most comfortable ride.  2 tubes/$15 William 240-6005",,,,,,,,,,
