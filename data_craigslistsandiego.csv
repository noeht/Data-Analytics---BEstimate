The Diamondback is what I'd call a bike for someone around 5' tall or so. The two Treks are rental quality.  We bought them to use everywhere and have zero issues.  If you aren't familiar with rental quality they are kinda bombproof.  They come with very tough frames and upgraded components plus things like tube liners and so forth.  We have loved these but we are headed in a different direction now. All three have a bit of rust.  All three will need a bit of attention.   The Treks were VERY expensive.  We bought them in Sonoma, California where we lived when we purchased them. The Diamondback is only $50. The Treks only have probably about 900,000 miles left. Thanks,",,,,,,,,

It honors a legacy both innovative and timeless. This year we collaborated with Vans, the original action sports footwear and apparel company, to produce the first-ever Vans PK Ripper, and we also made a limited-edition 16” version of the bike named the LiL’ Ripper. This means that even the youngsters have a chance to ride like the legends. The Vans LiL’ Ripper features details like a Vans checkerboard padset and Vans ‘66 valve caps.   Vans was founded in 1966 in Anaheim, CA, and the brand is embedded in BMX culture. Many top riders throughout the history of the sport including “PK” himself, Perry Kramer, have worn Vans shoes and ridden in many Vans-sponsored BMX races and events.

WITH PEDALS!  Shifter Lock Out Reserve Wheels (lifetime warranty) SRAM XO1 Eagle drivetrain  Strava says I've put 1,041.5 miles on the Blur. Aside from riding around to lube the grupo, cruising campsites, and just rolling with no strain, it should be pretty accurate. That's roughly 30 miles/month... next to nothing.  I added the Reserve Wheels and just bought new brake pads, new Ground Control Grid 2Bliss tires (lubed with Orange sealant), new silicone grips, and a new XO1 chain (all December 2021)... My mouth is watering just typing this stuff.  I'm not going to be racing much anymore, so I'm looking to move toward an all-mountain platform to ride with the girlfriend and buddies of my older generation. Not throwing in the towel yet, but I'm in my fifties now and have found reasons to pull back the speed a bit.  Thanks for checking out the bike. Please ask questions and I'll tell you all that I can.  The bike retailed at $9,400 new when I bought it.
