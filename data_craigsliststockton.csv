Calls will probably be answered between our normal business hours from 1pm - 12am West Coast time  CL only gives a max amount of photos at 24. There is another posting with more photos.  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------                                                                  !!!CRAZY STEVE'S F.A.Q!!?! -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: Who is ""Crazy Steve"" & why is he so crazy?  A: Crazy Steve is a client of mine who is selling the family farm of 40 years & everything on it. Steve asked us to help him try to move everything off the property before he sells. Some call Steve ""Crazy"" others call Steve a ""Collector"" - No Matter what you call him - he's having a liquidation sale and everything MUST GO!!!  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: So.......what IS exactly ....... ""Crazy Steve's Bargain Basket""?  A: Crazy Steve's Bargain Basket (aka: CSBB) Is not only a place where you can find unimaginable bargains & piles of junk, it's also the resting place of ""Circadian"" a business that is no longer in operation where they processed and sold refurbished medical equipment sometime back in the late 90's. Things like treadmills, EKG machines, heart monitors and a bunch of other weird things that you have probably never heard of! You never know what you might find back there! And (im sure) things that EVEN Crazy Ol' Steve didn't know he had!    -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: This is one of the weirdest adds iver ever seen on the market place. Is this a real place? Ive never heard of CSBB before. Is the person writing this ""Crazy Steve?""  A: No! I'm not Crazy Steve! Yes this is a real place! You have never heard of CSBB before and after this liquidation sale you never will again :-O  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: Why would anyone want anything here?  A: Great question!  TBH - We have no idea!!! But, we've got LOTS OF IT. Burning Man camp / art car project? Meow Wolf art installation materials? Shelves for your garage? Workbench for your shop? Spare parts for your electron microscope? (Yep got 2 of those here) Scrap metal for smelting? I guess that's why people love junk yards so much. Ya' never know!  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: I'm interested in something I saw in the photos! I'm interested in buying it, but there isn't ANY information about the item! Does it work? Float? Power up? There is literally NO information! How can I find answers to my questions?   A: Please call or txt CRAZY STEVE'S customer service phone #. Our team will be happy to answer your questions! Many of the things here do work, and there are equally just as many things that don't. It really depends on what item you're inquiring about. Some items may need a few things to get it working again. Depending on what that is, you can do it yourself or have us do it for you. Maybe it wont cost you anything. You can just take it! EVERYTHING MUST GO!!!!  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: I'm interested in one of the boats and trailers. But I see that its missing parts & I cant hook it up to my truck to get it out of there. If I need to spend money to fix it and get it out - can I take the cost of that part and reduce it from the total price?   A: Maybe. Depending on what needs to be done / paid for, we might be able to negotiate a different price.  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: Can I just take the trailer and not the boat?  A: Nope. If you want the trailer ya' gotta take the boat too. (Steve’s orders)  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: Is everything in the photo for sale?  A: In general most of what you see in the photo is for sale. If there is a bird in the photo or maybe a small tan dog THEY ARE NOT FOR SALE. STOP ASKING. But if you saw a cat in there or maybe 5 cats they are for sale! Please ask! :-) Many of the tools you see are NOT for sale (but it might be if you make an offer!) Please contact us via phone or txt during our normal business hours (2 pm - 12 pm) - for specific questions about which items are for sale.   -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: How much are you selling the ""__________"" for?  A: You never know what kind of deals you will find at CRAZY STEVE'S! We typically ask far less than what you would find in the used marketplace. In fact, sometimes we don't charge anything at all! Remember, Steve (bless his heart) is selling the family farm and EVERYTHING MUST GO!!! If there is no price for an item, make an offer, and if you don't want to pay anything and you're willing to take it off the property, Steve might just be totally into that!  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------  Q: Im looking at a ""________"" in the photo & I see that its missing parts. I'm wondering if it works?  A: Because of the intensity & sheer volume of items (literally thousands) here on the farm we haven't really taken the time to investigate all items listed. If you are interested about something, please give a call or text to the CS department & we will be happy to assist you during our normal business hours. Typically, if there is an item that we don't have information for immediately, we will investigate said item and get back to you a.s.a.p. with our response  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: What if I get home and it doesn't work?  A: Here at CRAZY STEVE'S - ALL SALES ARE FINAL! ABSOLUTELY NO RETURNS! All items are sold AS IS.  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: I can't make heads or tales of what I'm looking at in the photograph listed. Is there any way I can just go there myself and take a walk through? Where is this place anyway?  A: YES! Honestly, that's the best way! 1/2 the stuff here at CSBB we don't even know what it is!!!!! So come on down to CRAZY STEVE'S and have a look for yourself! (Gloves, tools, mask, eye protection, etc. is recommended) CSBB is located about 10 minutes drive west of Valley Springs, about 40 mins east of Stockton.  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: I don't have a lot of tools but i'll need some to get the ""_______"" off the property and into my vehicle. Do you have tools I can use?  A: YES - There are lots of tools at CSBB (but not all tools) that you can use to get what you need. But bringing your own tools are recommended as we dont have everything you might need.   -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: Why does everything in your photos look so..... well.... crazy?  A: CRAZY STEVE!  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: WHATS IN THE BASKET?!

Calls will probably be answered between our normal business hours from 1pm - 12am West Coast time  CL only gives a max amount of photos at 24. There is another posting with more photos.  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------                                                                  !!!CRAZY STEVE'S F.A.Q!!?! -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: Who is ""Crazy Steve"" & why is he so crazy?  A: Crazy Steve is a client of mine who is selling the family farm of 40 years & everything on it. Steve asked us to help him try to move everything off the property before he sells. Some call Steve ""Crazy"" others call Steve a ""Collector"" - No Matter what you call him - he's having a liquidation sale and everything MUST GO!!!  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: So.......what IS exactly ....... ""Crazy Steve's Bargain Basket""?  A: Crazy Steve's Bargain Basket (aka: CSBB) Is not only a place where you can find unimaginable bargains & piles of junk, it's also the resting place of ""Circadian"" a business that is no longer in operation where they processed and sold refurbished medical equipment sometime back in the late 90's. Things like treadmills, EKG machines, heart monitors and a bunch of other weird things that you have probably never heard of! You never know what you might find back there! And (im sure) things that EVEN Crazy Ol' Steve didn't know he had!    -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: This is one of the weirdest adds iver ever seen on the market place. Is this a real place? Ive never heard of CSBB before. Is the person writing this ""Crazy Steve?""  A: No! I'm not Crazy Steve! Yes this is a real place! You have never heard of CSBB before and after this liquidation sale you never will again :-O  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: Why would anyone want anything here?  A: Great question!  TBH - We have no idea!!! But, we've got LOTS OF IT. Burning Man camp / art car project? Meow Wolf art installation materials? Shelves for your garage? Workbench for your shop? Spare parts for your electron microscope? (Yep got 2 of those here) Scrap metal for smelting? I guess that's why people love junk yards so much. Ya' never know!  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: I'm interested in something I saw in the photos! I'm interested in buying it, but there isn't ANY information about the item! Does it work? Float? Power up? There is literally NO information! How can I find answers to my questions?   A: Please call or txt CRAZY STEVE'S customer service phone #. Our team will be happy to answer your questions! Many of the things here do work, and there are equally just as many things that don't. It really depends on what item you're inquiring about. Some items may need a few things to get it working again. Depending on what that is, you can do it yourself or have us do it for you. Maybe it wont cost you anything. You can just take it! EVERYTHING MUST GO!!!!  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: I'm interested in one of the boats and trailers. But I see that its missing parts & I cant hook it up to my truck to get it out of there. If I need to spend money to fix it and get it out - can I take the cost of that part and reduce it from the total price?   A: Maybe. Depending on what needs to be done / paid for, we might be able to negotiate a different price.  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: Can I just take the trailer and not the boat?  A: Nope. If you want the trailer ya' gotta take the boat too. (Steve’s orders)  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: Is everything in the photo for sale?  A: In general most of what you see in the photo is for sale. If there is a bird in the photo or maybe a small tan dog THEY ARE NOT FOR SALE. STOP ASKING. But if you saw a cat in there or maybe 5 cats they are for sale! Please ask! :-) Many of the tools you see are NOT for sale (but it might be if you make an offer!) Please contact us via phone or txt during our normal business hours (2 pm - 12 pm) - for specific questions about which items are for sale.   -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: How much are you selling the ""__________"" for?  A: You never know what kind of deals you will find at CRAZY STEVE'S! We typically ask far less than what you would find in the used marketplace. In fact, sometimes we don't charge anything at all! Remember, Steve (bless his heart) is selling the family farm and EVERYTHING MUST GO!!! If there is no price for an item, make an offer, and if you don't want to pay anything and you're willing to take it off the property, Steve might just be totally into that!  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------  Q: Im looking at a ""________"" in the photo & I see that its missing parts. I'm wondering if it works?  A: Because of the intensity & sheer volume of items (literally thousands) here on the farm we haven't really taken the time to investigate all items listed. If you are interested about something, please give a call or text to the CS department & we will be happy to assist you during our normal business hours. Typically, if there is an item that we don't have information for immediately, we will investigate said item and get back to you a.s.a.p. with our response  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: What if I get home and it doesn't work?  A: Here at CRAZY STEVE'S - ALL SALES ARE FINAL! ABSOLUTELY NO RETURNS! All items are sold AS IS.  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: I can't make heads or tales of what I'm looking at in the photograph listed. Is there any way I can just go there myself and take a walk through? Where is this place anyway?  A: YES! Honestly, that's the best way! 1/2 the stuff here at CSBB we don't even know what it is!!!!! So come on down to CRAZY STEVE'S and have a look for yourself! (Gloves, tools, mask, eye protection, etc. is recommended) CSBB is located about 10 minutes drive west of Valley Springs, about 40 mins east of Stockton.  -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: I don't have a lot of tools but i'll need some to get the ""_______"" off the property and into my vehicle. Do you have tools I can use?  A: YES - There are lots of tools at CSBB (but not all tools) that you can use to get what you need. But bringing your own tools are recommended as we dont have everything you might need.   -----------------------------------------------   --------  -------  ------  ---- ----  --- - -   ----------------------------------------------------   Q: Why does everything in your photos look so..... well.... crazy?

Here is a glimpse at just the top ten uses of utility trailers:  1.Automobiles: From time to time it becomes necessary to haul an inoperable car or truck. Tow trucks are expensive, especially if the distance is great. A utility trailer is a great way to haul vehicles and a good investment if you need to do so regularly.  2.Boats: If you have a boat, you will need a utility trailer to get it to and from the water.  3.Lawn Care Equipment: If you live in a rural area, you may find that you need to haul your mowing equipment from one piece of your property to another. Packing equipment and loading it into a pickup truck bed can get old very quickly. A utility trailer will allow you to drive your equipment right up onto the trailer without the aid of ramps or two strong men.  4.Furniture: Moving furniture is a breeze with a utility trailer. Furniture dollies roll right up onto the trailer and you can haul more than you can with a pickup.  5.Building Supplies: Do you have projects that need to be done around the house? Pick up your own building supplies and save on delivery fees.  6.Bikes, Motorcycles, and ATVs: Recreational vehicles are best hauled on a utility trailer.  7.Livestock: An enclosed utility trailer is most often used to haul livestock.  8.Auction and Flea Markets: If you frequent auctions and flea markets, you will need the hauling capability to bring home your inexpensive and rare finds.  9.Appliances: Utility trailers are ideal for hauling appliances.  10.Debris and Trash: Loading trash in and out of your pickup bed can be cumbersome and clean up can be messy, but it would be worse to have to haul trash in your SUV. Clean up after a big job is a lot easier with a utility trailer.  As you can see, there are many reasons why an investment in a utility trailer is a smart move. I'm sure that with a little time, and its easy availability, you will come up with even more ways to use a trailer  ATV UTV SXS MOTORCYCLE BIKE TRANSPORT HAUL MOVE CAR TRUCK MOVING TRAVELING STORAGE CARGO LOADS AUTHORITY BOAT HAULING BUSINESS BUSINESS FOR SALE JOB SALES CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT STEEL RAZOR SNOWMOBILE POLARIS YAHAMA WILD CAT MACHINE AUTOMOBILE AUTO VAN TOWING TOW VECHICLE SNOW RAIN BOX TRUCK FLATBED GOOSNECK BUMPER PULL HITCH BALL WEATHER BUY WOOD Westchester County, NY Amawalk, Annsville, Archville, Ardsley, Ardsley-on-Hudson, Armawalk, Armonk, Arthur Manor, Banksville, Bayberry Park, Bedford, Bedford Center, Bedford Hills, Beech Hill, Beechmont, Beechmont Woods, Bonnie Crest, Boutonville, Briarcliff Manor, Bronxville, Bronxville Heights, Bryn Mawr Park, Buchanan, Buckhout Corners, Butlerville, Cecil Park, Cedar Knolls, Chappaqua, Chauncey, Chester Hill Park, Chimney Corners, Colonial Acres, Colonial Heights, Crestwood, Crestwood Gardens, Crompond, Cross River, Croton Falls, Croton Heights, Croton-on-Hudson, Crotonville, Crugers, Dobbs Ferry, Dunwoodie, Dunwoodie Heights, East Irvington, East White Plains, East Woods, Eastchester, Eastview, Elmsford, Elmsmere, Fairview, Fleetwood, Forest Knolls, Fox Meadow, Furnace Woods, Gallows Hill, Glendale, Glenville, Glenwood, Goldens Bridge, Graham, Granite Springs, Grant Corner, Greenhaven, Greenville, Grey Oaks, Greystone, Gunther Park, Harrison, Hartsdale, Hastings-on-Hudson, Hawthorne, Heath Ridge, Heathcote, Heritage Hills, Homestead Park, Horseshoe Hill, Horton Estates, Huguenot Park, Irvington, Isle of San Souci, Jefferson Valley, Katonah, Kitchawan, Lake Katonah, Lake Lincolndale, Lake Mohegan, Lake Purdy, Larchmont, Lawrence Park, Lewisboro, Lincoln, Lincolndale, Lowerre, Ludlow, Mamaroneck, Maplewood, Mariandale, Millwood, Milton, Mohegan Heights, Mohegan Lake, Montrose, Mount Airy, Mount Hope, Mount Kisco, Mount Pleasant, Mount Vernon, Murdock Woods, Murray Hill, Nepera Park, Nepperhan, New Rochelle, North Salem, North White Plains, Oceola Lake, Orienta, Oscawana, Ossining, Park Hill, Parkside, Peekskill, Pelham, Pelham Manor, Philipse Manor, Pinebrook, Pinebrook Heights, Pleasantside, Pleasantville, Pocantico Hills, Port Chester, Pound Ridge, Purchase, Purdys, Purdys Grove, Quaker Ridge, Quarry Heights, Residence Park, Ridgeway, Rochelle Heights, Rochelle Park, Roe Park, Rosedale, Rye, Rye Brook, Salem Center, Sarles Corners, Scarborough, Scarsdale, Scarsdale Downs, Scarsdale Park, Scotts Corners, Secor Gardens, Shenorock, Sherman Park, Shore Acres, Shrub Oak, Sleepy Hollow, Sleepy Hollow Manor, Somers, South Salem, Sparta, Spring Valley, Stanwood, Sun Haven, Sunny Brae, Tarrytown, Thornwood, Toddville, Tompkins Corners, Tuckahoe, Twin Lakes Village, Valhalla, Valley Pond Estates, Van Cortlandtville, Vernon Park, Verplanck, Victory Park, Vista, Waccabuc, Waverly, West Mount Vernon, White Birches, White Plains, Whitehall Corners, Wilmot Woods, Windmill Farm, Woodlands, Woodybrook, Worthington, Wykagyl, Wykagyl Park, Yonkers, Yorktown, Yorktown Heights, brooklyn, queens, manhattan, nyc, bronx, staten island, long island, hudson valley",,,,

For 2013, the Electra Glide® Ultra Limited model comes in a limited, serialized 110th Anniversary Special Edition, featuring exclusive commemorative anniversary styling elements and premium features that make it a top-of-the-line model and a true work of living art, with finely forged finishes that age and transform in a manner unique to each vehicle. Some of the bike's premium features include: air-cooled Twin Cam 103™ engine for powerful performance, ABS brakes, heated hand grips, titanium face gauges, Tour-Pak inserts, a premium Tour-Pak luggage rack, 28-Spoke contrast chrome wheels, and special Ultra Limited identifier medallions. Also found on the Harley® Electra Glide® Ultra touring bike is a 6 gallon fuel tank so you have to stop less for fuel. Harley® has many other motorcycle touring bikes, all to provide you with comfort and style. Be sure to look at the Road Glide Ultra with its frame mounted Harley® fairing for your motorcycle travel as well as all of the other H-D® touring motorcycles.110th Anniversary Gas Tank Medallion (Optional)Each Anniversary Edition Harley-Davidson® is a unique masterpiece, with its very own work of art marking it as part of this historic celebration. Forged of solid bronze and plated with black nickel, each Anniversary medallion is then distressed to highlight the bronze. And since no two can ever distress the same, each becomes a completely unique commemorative ""sculpture."" The finishing touch is a bold gold Cloisonné showing the Harley-Davidson® Bar and Shield. (Available only on 110th Anniversary Edition models)Twin Cam 103™ Engine HeritageThe knowledge of what makes an engine truly move a rider runs deep at The Motor Company, and it was put to good use when we created the Twin Cam 103™ engine. We painstakingly perfected every cubic inch, pushing design and technology forward—all without compromising one bit of Harley-Davidson®'s unique styling. Evolved, yet carrying on the legacy of the Flathead, Knucklehead, Panhead, Shovelhead, Evolution®, Twin Cam 88® and Twin Cam 96™ engines that came before. The performance and durability are a direct result of the untold miles logged on the V-Twin since 1909, and the proud heritage that comes from a century's worth of commitment to life on two wheels.Harman/Kardon® Advanced Audio SystemNaturally, the king of the road gets some royal extras. The premium two-speaker, 20-watt per channel Harman/Kardon® audio system boasts great sound for booming down the boulevard and highway, and, yeah, it might as well go to 11. It's loud, proud and comes with AM/FM receiver and accommodates a CD or MP3 player. Riding free just wouldn't be the same without the right soundtrack.Dunlop® Multi-Tread™ TiresThe 180mm back tire is engineered to do more than fill out the rear fender and put a bigger patch of rubber on the road. Dunlop® Multi-Tread™ technology uses harder compounds at the center and softer on the sides for a tire that still knows how to knuckle-down on corners. Perfect for making this bike agile on every curvy stretch of road. And the way it feels going through an abrupt off-camber turn will put a grin on your face that'll last to the next state line.Enter this link to see more images plus all other inventory we have available: http://lyv.cc/DABEQBasic Information:Year: 2013Make: Harley-Davidson®Model: FLHTK - Electra Glide Ultra LimitedStock Number: U09902Condition: UsedType: TouringMileage: 42,079Title: CleanColor: Blue/BlackBrakes:ABS BrakesBrake Brand Name: BremboFront Brake: Dual Hydraulic DiscFront Brake Diameter (in): 11.5Front Brake Diameter (mm): 292.1Linked Brake System Front to RearRear Brake: Hydraulic DiscRear Brake Diameter (in): 11.5Rear Brake Diameter (mm): 292.1Chassis & Suspension:Air Adjustable Rear SuspensionFrame: SteelFront Adjustable Rebound DampingFront Suspension Type: Telescopic ForkNumber Rear Shock Absorbers: 2Rear Adjustable Rebound DampingRear Adjustable Shock / Spring Pre-LoadRear Suspension Material: SteelRear Suspension Type: Twin Sided Swing ArmComfort:CB RadioCruise ControlDigital InstrumentationHeated Hand Grip Location: DriverIntercomOil Pressure GaugeNumber Of Speakers: 4Trip OdometerRadio Brand Name: Harman/KardonSeat BackrestDrivetrain:Heel Toe ShifterNumber Of Speeds: 6Primary Drive (Rear Wheel): BeltTransmission: ManualPrimary Drive (Engine / Transmission): ChainTransmission Gear Ratio (1): 9.59Transmission Gear Ratio (2): 6.65Transmission Gear Ratio (3): 4.94Transmission Gear Ratio (4): 4Transmission Gear Ratio (5): 3.41Transmission Gear Ratio (6): 2.86Engine:Bore (in): 3.88Bore (mm): 98.5Carburetion Type: Fuel InjectedCompression Ratio: 9.6Cooling System: AirCylinders: 2Engine Brand Name: Twin Cam 103Engine Disp. to Weight (cc): 1.91Engine ImmobilizerEngine Immobilizer Brand: Digitally Encoded Security System (DESS)Engine Size (cc): 1687Engine Size (ci): 103Engine Stroke: 4-StrokeEngine Type: V TwinFuel Capacity (gal): 6Fuel InjectorFuel Requirements: PremiumStarter: ElectricStroke (in): 4.38Stroke (mm): 111.3Torque (Ft Lbs): 100Torque (Nm): 135.6Torque RPM: 3250US Miles Per Gallon (Combined): 42Valve Configuration: OHV - PushrodValves: 4Valves Per Cylinder: 2Other Information:Bag LinersBag Liner Material: VinylChassis ProtectorsChromed WheelsEngine Case GuardExterior CoversExterior GuardsFloor BoardsFront FenderFront Fender RailFront Fender TrimGlove Box / Dash StorageHand GripsHard Side CasesHard Side Case Location: Left and Right SideHard Side Case Number: 2Helmet StorageLockable StorageLower FairingSaddle Bag GuardSide CoverRear FenderRear Fender TrimRear RackRear Rack StorageSide Storage MountSide Case MountStandStand Type: KickTool Bag MountUpper FairingTank DividerTank Divider Material: LeatherWind DeflectorWindshieldWindshield Brand: Lexan®Windshield MountsSafety:HeadlightHeadlight Mounting BarHeadlight Type: HalogenFuel Level WarningRearview MirrorsPassing LampsSpecifications:Dry Weight (kg): 400.1Dry Weight (lbs): 882Front Tire (Full Spec): Dunlop Multi-Tread 130/80 R17 65HFront Tire (Inches): 17Front Tire Aspect Ratio: 80Front Tire Width: 130Fuel Capacity (liters): 22Ground Clearance (in): 5.1Ground Clearance (mm): 129.5Length (inches): 98Length (mm): 2504.4Rear Tire (Full Spec): Dunlop Multi-Tread 180/65 R16 81HRear Tire (Inches): 16Rear Tire Aspect Ratio: 65Rear Tire Speed Rating: 81HRear Tire Width: 180Seat Height (inches): 29Wet Weight (kg): 413.2Wet Weight (lbs): 911Wheelbase (in): 63.5Wheelbase (mm): 1612.9Wheels Composition: AluminumSpeedometerTachometerHarley-Davidson of Folsom115 Woodmere RoadFolsom, CA 95630Ask for: Sales DepartmentMain: (916) 608-9922A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 33973357 10402347",,,,

Here is a glimpse at just the top ten uses of utility trailers:  1.Automobiles: From time to time it becomes necessary to haul an inoperable car or truck. Tow trucks are expensive, especially if the distance is great. A utility trailer is a great way to haul vehicles and a good investment if you need to do so regularly.  2.Boats: If you have a boat, you will need a utility trailer to get it to and from the water.  3.Lawn Care Equipment: If you live in a rural area, you may find that you need to haul your mowing equipment from one piece of your property to another. Packing equipment and loading it into a pickup truck bed can get old very quickly. A utility trailer will allow you to drive your equipment right up onto the trailer without the aid of ramps or two strong men.  4.Furniture: Moving furniture is a breeze with a utility trailer. Furniture dollies roll right up onto the trailer and you can haul more than you can with a pickup.  5.Building Supplies: Do you have projects that need to be done around the house? Pick up your own building supplies and save on delivery fees.  6.Bikes, Motorcycles, and ATVs: Recreational vehicles are best hauled on a utility trailer.  7.Livestock: An enclosed utility trailer is most often used to haul livestock.  8.Auction and Flea Markets: If you frequent auctions and flea markets, you will need the hauling capability to bring home your inexpensive and rare finds.  9.Appliances: Utility trailers are ideal for hauling appliances.  10.Debris and Trash: Loading trash in and out of your pickup bed can be cumbersome and clean up can be messy, but it would be worse to have to haul trash in your SUV. Clean up after a big job is a lot easier with a utility trailer.  As you can see, there are many reasons why an investment in a utility trailer is a smart move. I'm sure that with a little time, and its easy availability, you will come up with even more ways to use a trailer  ATV UTV SXS MOTORCYCLE BIKE TRANSPORT HAUL MOVE CAR TRUCK MOVING TRAVELING STORAGE CARGO LOADS AUTHORITY BOAT HAULING BUSINESS BUSINESS FOR SALE JOB SALES CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT STEEL RAZOR SNOWMOBILE POLARIS YAHAMA WILD CAT MACHINE AUTOMOBILE AUTO VAN TOWING TOW VECHICLE SNOW RAIN BOX TRUCK FLATBED GOOSNECK BUMPER PULL HITCH BALL WEATHER BUY WOOD Westchester County, NY Amawalk, Annsville, Archville, Ardsley, Ardsley-on-Hudson, Armawalk, Armonk, Arthur Manor, Banksville, Bayberry Park, Bedford, Bedford Center, Bedford Hills, Beech Hill, Beechmont, Beechmont Woods, Bonnie Crest, Boutonville, Briarcliff Manor, Bronxville, Bronxville Heights, Bryn Mawr Park, Buchanan, Buckhout Corners, Butlerville, Cecil Park, Cedar Knolls, Chappaqua, Chauncey, Chester Hill Park, Chimney Corners, Colonial Acres, Colonial Heights, Crestwood, Crestwood Gardens, Crompond, Cross River, Croton Falls, Croton Heights, Croton-on-Hudson, Crotonville, Crugers, Dobbs Ferry, Dunwoodie, Dunwoodie Heights, East Irvington, East White Plains, East Woods, Eastchester, Eastview, Elmsford, Elmsmere, Fairview, Fleetwood, Forest Knolls, Fox Meadow, Furnace Woods, Gallows Hill, Glendale, Glenville, Glenwood, Goldens Bridge, Graham, Granite Springs, Grant Corner, Greenhaven, Greenville, Grey Oaks, Greystone, Gunther Park, Harrison, Hartsdale, Hastings-on-Hudson, Hawthorne, Heath Ridge, Heathcote, Heritage Hills, Homestead Park, Horseshoe Hill, Horton Estates, Huguenot Park, Irvington, Isle of San Souci, Jefferson Valley, Katonah, Kitchawan, Lake Katonah, Lake Lincolndale, Lake Mohegan, Lake Purdy, Larchmont, Lawrence Park, Lewisboro, Lincoln, Lincolndale, Lowerre, Ludlow, Mamaroneck, Maplewood, Mariandale, Millwood, Milton, Mohegan Heights, Mohegan Lake, Montrose, Mount Airy, Mount Hope, Mount Kisco, Mount Pleasant, Mount Vernon, Murdock Woods, Murray Hill, Nepera Park, Nepperhan, New Rochelle, North Salem, North White Plains, Oceola Lake, Orienta, Oscawana, Ossining, Park Hill, Parkside, Peekskill, Pelham, Pelham Manor, Philipse Manor, Pinebrook, Pinebrook Heights, Pleasantside, Pleasantville, Pocantico Hills, Port Chester, Pound Ridge, Purchase, Purdys, Purdys Grove, Quaker Ridge, Quarry Heights, Residence Park, Ridgeway, Rochelle Heights, Rochelle Park, Roe Park, Rosedale, Rye, Rye Brook, Salem Center, Sarles Corners, Scarborough, Scarsdale, Scarsdale Downs, Scarsdale Park, Scotts Corners, Secor Gardens, Shenorock, Sherman Park, Shore Acres, Shrub Oak, Sleepy Hollow, Sleepy Hollow Manor, Somers, South Salem, Sparta, Spring Valley, Stanwood, Sun Haven, Sunny Brae, Tarrytown, Thornwood, Toddville, Tompkins Corners, Tuckahoe, Twin Lakes Village, Valhalla, Valley Pond Estates, Van Cortlandtville, Vernon Park, Verplanck, Victory Park, Vista, Waccabuc, Waverly, West Mount Vernon, White Birches, White Plains, Whitehall Corners, Wilmot Woods, Windmill Farm, Woodlands, Woodybrook, Worthington, Wykagyl, Wykagyl Park, Yonkers, Yorktown, Yorktown Heights, brooklyn, queens, manhattan, nyc, bronx, staten island, long island, hudson valley",,,,

The Harley-Davidson® Breakout® model has a stretched, slammed custom style that's low, long and aggressive. It's driven by a powerful air-cooled Twin Cam 103™ Harley® engine with 6 speed cruise drive transmission that provides more performance power for passing and hill-climbing, and a low cruising RPM for more comfortable cruising. The big, bold Gasser wheels have alternating-position spokes with alternating Vivid Black and machined treatments. The FXSB Softail® Breakout® model's Gasser wheels recall the powerful, muscular wheels of classic 1960s and 1970s dragster bikes. The H-D® FXSB model's Big V-Twin engine has a unique, sharp-looking Vivid Black and Chrome treatment. The massive 240 mm rear tire on the Breakout model is the widest wheel on any Harley® production motorcycle.Features may include:Breakout to the NewDon't just break the mold—forge your own with the latest chapter in Harley-Davidson®'s legacy of freedom. A premium custom cruiser inspired by the classic Gasser drag bikes of the '50s and '60s, the Softail® Breakout® model rolls with modern power, top-of-the-line treatments and lots of low-down menace. Big wheels, big paint, big chrome, all wrapped in a refined style—the Breakout® model is a true attention-grabber with a ride that's been painstakingly engineered for fun whether you're winding mountain roads or cruising the strip. It may be low-profile, but the Breakout® motorcycle always makes a big, bold statement.Low Muscular ProfileWith its big, bold stance, the Breakout® motorcycle makes a powerful impact even standing still. Its pure, clean lines, low-slung profile, stretched stance, big wheels and chopped fenders all shout premium custom, solid power and ""look at me"" attitude, even as its performance makes it your choice who gets to stare and for how long before you disappear.Twin Cam 103™ Engine PowerLive your ride to the power of Twin Cam 103™. The air cooled Twin Cam 103™ Harley-Davidson® engine delivers more stump pulling torque, while its Electronic Sequential Port Fuel Injection jetting gives crisp, lively throttle reaction. It’s a performance punch you’ll appreciate when passing, climbing hills, or just catching eyes as you cruise by—all under that signature Motor Company rumble. And it comes at lower cruising rpm, so you ride more smoothly, with less engine vibration and better highway fuel economy.You may be cruising with swagger, but you know safety counts. This sophisticated, factory-installed ABS gives 'stopping power' a double meaning. Its components are tastefully hidden within the wheel hub, so you'll still turn heads with clean, streamlined design. But more importantly, you get certainty in the saddle knowing your bike's going to behave when you need it.Balanced Suspension & HandlingThe Breakout® model may be a big bold bike with a powerful stretched stance, but it's definitely not just for show. We carefully balanced and damped its suspension to give it a neutral feel—even with those big, wide tires—and engineered it for lightness, for an excellent power-to-weight ratio. The bottom line? A smooth, fun ride whether roaring from stoplight to stoplight or winding along country roads.Enter this link to see more images plus all other inventory we have available: http://lyv.cc/U4YRABasic Information:Year: 2014Make: Harley-Davidson®Model: SoftailTrim: FXSB - BreakoutStock Number: U24584Condition: UsedType: CruiserMileage: 15,652Title: CleanColor: BlackAccent Color: BlackBrakes:ABS BrakesBrake Brand Name: BremboFront Brake: Hydraulic DiscFront Brake Diameter (in): 11.5Front Brake Diameter (mm): 292.1Rear Brake: Hydraulic DiscRear Brake Diameter (in): 11.5Rear Brake Diameter (mm): 292.1Chassis & Suspension:Air Adjustable Rear SuspensionFrame: SteelFront Suspension Type: Telescopic ForkNumber Rear Shock Absorbers: 2Rear Suspension Material: SteelRear Suspension Type: Twin Sided Swing ArmComfort:Digital InstrumentationTrip OdometerDrivetrain:Heel Toe ShifterNumber Of Speeds: 6Primary Drive (Rear Wheel): BeltTransmission: ManualPrimary Drive (Engine / Transmission): ChainTransmission Gear Ratio (1): 9.311Transmission Gear Ratio (2): 6.454Transmission Gear Ratio (3): 4.793Transmission Gear Ratio (4): 3.882Transmission Gear Ratio (5): 3.307Transmission Gear Ratio (6): 2.79Engine:Bore (in): 3.87Bore (mm): 98.3Carburetion Type: Fuel InjectedCompression Ratio: 9.6Cooling System: AirCylinders: 2Engine Brand Name: Twin Cam 103Engine Disp. to Weight (cc): 2.51Engine Size (cc): 1689Engine Size (ci): 103.1Engine Stroke: 4-StrokeEngine Type: V TwinFuel Capacity (gal): 5Fuel InjectorFuel Requirements: PremiumStarter: ElectricStroke (in): 4.37Stroke (mm): 111Torque (Ft Lbs): 95.2Torque (Nm): 129.1Torque RPM: 3000US Miles Per Gallon (Combined): 42Valve Configuration: OHV - PushrodValves: 4Valves Per Cylinder: 2Other Information:Belt GuardDetachable Passenger SeatExterior CoversExterior GuardsFoot PegsFoot Peg Location: Driver and PassengerFront FenderHand GripsSide CoverRear FenderRear Fender RailStandStand Type: KickTank DividerSafety:HeadlightHeadlight Type: HalogenFuel Level WarningRearview MirrorsSpecifications:Dry Weight (kg): 304.8Dry Weight (lbs): 672Front Tire (Full Spec): Dunlop 130/60 R21 63HFront Tire (Inches): 21Front Tire Aspect Ratio: 60Front Tire Width: 130Fuel Capacity (liters): 18Ground Clearance (in): 4.7Ground Clearance (mm): 119.4Length (inches): 96Length (mm): 2446Rear Tire (Full Spec): Dunlop 240/40 R18 79VRear Tire (Inches): 18Rear Tire Aspect Ratio: 40Rear Tire Speed Rating: 79VRear Tire Width: 240Seat Height (inches): 26Wet Weight (kg): 322.1Wet Weight (lbs): 710Wheelbase (in): 67.3Wheelbase (mm): 1709.4Wheels Composition: AluminumSpeedometerTachometerHarley-Davidson of Folsom115 Woodmere RoadFolsom, CA 95630Ask for: Sales DepartmentMain: (916) 608-9922A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 32780718 10374541",,,,

Whether riding one, or building a new one from LED headlamp to taillight. Welcome to the top of the line bagger.Features May Include:Project RUSHMORE - ControlHere are some of the innovations Project RUSHMORE led to: the Reflex™ Linked Brakes with ABS, the Daymaker™ LED headlamps and fog lamps, brighter turn signals, brighter brake lights, and a steering head with stiffer front forks. Locked-up tires are now history even when there's wet pavement. We'??ve made it feel even better to lean your way through a turn. Now you can see better. And we'??ve made you more conspicuous to the cage-driving public. Because one thing we all agree on is this: bikes that work better make riders who ride better. Take a ride. See how good you can be.Project RUSHMORE - EngineAs every rider knows, the engine is at the heart of the experience of riding a motorcycle. The amount of torque and horsepower it delivers over the RPM range is in direct proportion to the feeling it gives you when you roll on the throttle. We know what riders want from a motorcycle engine because we've been building them for 110 years. Project RUSHMORE gave us the opportunity to dial it in just right. We conducted thousands of road tests with real riders giving us feedback to build the next iteration of the legendary Harley-Davidson® engine. The consensus was: We want more. More low-end torque, more passing power, more perfection in the tone of the exhaust note, more of the feeling we ride a motorcycle for. And last year, we unveiled the engines that deliver it. This is the next level of Harley-Davidson® V-Twin engine. And it proves, once and for all, the customer is always right.Project RUSHMORE - InfotainmentMore sound. Purer sound. Big, full-color touch screens. Switches that are located where you intuitively want them to be and can reach without removing your hands from the grips. Voice activation for your music, phone and GPS. Or as more than one rider asked: ""Why can'??t the infotainment system on my motorcycle blow away the ones the car companies put in their cars?"" We couldn'??t agree more. Check out the infotainment system Project RUSHMORE brought to the sport of motorcycling. You won'??t believe your eyes. Or ears.Project RUSHMORE - ComfortWe dialed in the comfort of our machines the hard way: over thousands of miles in all kinds of riding conditions on every kind of street, road and highway ever laid down in pavement. Experienced riders and passengers putting in long hours in the saddle and giving us feedback on every aspect that contributes to comfort on the road. Airflow, heat management, passenger space, back rests, seat textures, legroom and hand controls all went under the hard microscope of the road and got tested and re-tested by real riders and worked and re-worked by us until we were satisfied we had built the most comfortable machines on the road.
