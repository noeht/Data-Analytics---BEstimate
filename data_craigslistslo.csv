Renewed Reg May 2023 Photos taken 04/20/2022.  Bike starts and runs, doesnt smoke under hard acceleration and makes decent power. Compression is fine. Can do a wheelie if you want and go 120mph, but realize it weighs 600lbs. She's a road warrior, not a BMX bike.   No tire kickers and garage princess folks. She's my little Rocinante Panzer Princess. Hopefully you are a person that understands why the BMW community loves this bike so much. I even got the Lenny Rocket Sprockets if you wanna install them in the future.  If you read everything below, this price is a steal (ill even say I sold it to you for $100).  If you know your way around a bike, especially BMW maintenance, you'll realize why this is a gem of a buy for you. Turnkey ready, mechanically sound, new fluids, pads, filters, fuses, solid tires, bright LEDs, new clutch, new upgraded metal head gaskets and new valve cover seals, new fuel injectors, heads recently serviced and timing set. You literally don't need to do anything but ride it. I'm forthcoming about anything on it, so just ask.   Bikes require regular maintenance, and usually only BMW mechanics will work on BMW bikes. So you either give them your arm and leg, or you do it all yourself. If you read below, I've shown you how easy it is to do yourself with detailed resources/videos/manuals/guides/schematics with detailed part numbers and more.  Please be a serious buyer and communicate with me to set a date to see it. I'm in the AG/Grover/Pismo area. Too many flakey people lately.    259 (R 850 GS, R 1100 GS) BMW R 1100 GS. Type Code: 0409 Produced 05/1994  This is all the info you will ever need for parts on this bike Ebay, Amazon, wherever. Schematics for all the parts and part numbers here: RealOEM.com. They have detailed photographs sectioned out for each part of the bike with part numbers as well as their compatibility with parts on newer models. My PDF manual, type a keyword and find the maintenance piece you need broken down in elaborate detail.   I love this bike immensely. Can carry a lot of stuff, great on mileage, handles beautifully. She’s like the hot girlfriend everyone can’t stop staring at. Loud guttural poppy engine, not meant for hauling ass like on a sport bike but great for all around travel (yes she can do a wheelie, but shes also like 500-600lbs). Regular compliments and stoke from enthusiasts all around. She is truly a tough and beautiful panzer. I am sad to see her go, but I need the money and have a truck already. I just hope you enjoy it as much as I have and give her the love I wish I could. Clean title in hand.  Mechanic owned, regular maintenance done and can provide you the mileage/photos/receipts of when it was all done so you can keep track too. She's got some paint flakes, scratches, etc, but she's Rocinante, total work horse.  Lot's of amazing spare parts, bolts, tools, and other useful stuff included below. I am going to be super thorough in here because I like selling things better than when I found them. Brake fluid, brake pads, and oil serviced less than 1k miles ago. All the mission critical stuff on it is pretty new so you don't have to do much other than oil changes.  $3700 OBO, cash-in-hand to ride. Read the whole listing here because there's a lot of awesome stuff I'm giving ya. Know this bike down to every nut and bolt, been riding BMW's for 10 years now.   Valid license and/or M1 License required (usually I'll take a photo of your license and you can have a friend with you stay with me while you ride it), I have a spare helmet and jacket if needed. If you drop it, you buy it although it has caging around the valve covers so it wouldn't be much of a big deal. I can ride to you or you can meet me somewhere in the area.   Perks  • Lots of key maintenance done and an entirely new clutch, she is looking for new adventures, still room for other fun projects. • Paper manual with photos and easily searchable pdf manual with drawn schematics included. • Tags recently renewed in CA. Good til May 2022. Insurance is $15 a month, it is amazing. Clean title in hand  • Nice adjustable windscreen • Digital Oil Temp, Gear Position, and Fuel Level Readouts • ABS system for safe breaking • Super Bright White LED lights • Cell phone mount for GPS • Passenger Seat Included • PIAA Fog Lights (helps a lot when you are out in the country) • Side/Back Carrying Cases with locks and keys with black reflector tape. You can fit an amazing amount of things in the cases and back of the bike with ropes/bunjee chords. Just did a big sur run with like 300lbs on it.  • Engine cage oilpan/protector and highway footrests • I have Lennie’s Rocket Sprockets but have not installed them yet ($250 shipped from AUS). Supposed to help with torque all around. Also helps with the slow torque response at higher speeds/RPM’s and gears. • SPARE set of cleaned cylinder heads/pushrods/rockers/valves/springs/camshafts/new valve stem seals, etc. I bought an extra pair off Ebay because a bolt broke.   • Spare functional stock fuel injectors, airbox rubber boots/grommets • Spare new PIAA Fog Light wiring harnesses/relay switch/fuse (they sent me two for some reason)  Key Maintenance/Parts/Upgrades • 53K: New rear main seal, new clutch kit from Bosch, all fluids flushed (drives, brake fluid, oil, etc), new rear brake pads, new AGM battery • 62K: New iridium single electrode spark plugs (Densos) • 62K: New continental alternator belt • 62K: New metal head and rubber gaskets/o rings etc from Athena, new valve stem seals and collets, piston and compression chambers thoroughly cleaned of all carbon deposits, valve timing set, oil changed • 62K: New upgraded Bosch V14 fuel injectors (4 pintels instead of one) used on newer R1200 models. • 62K: New Air Filter • 63K: 600mile valve maintenance follow up. Slackened head bolts retightened, valve timing readjusted (new oil and oil filter 20W50 motorcycle oil), throttle bodies resynched. • 63K: New ABS mirrors, new PIAA fog light relay/fuse/wiring • 63K: New starter • 64k front brake pads replaced and fluids flushed   Other stuff that is helpful • Most of the bolts are 3,4, 6, 8, 10mm with a pitch of 1.25 if you need a handful ever from a hardware store • Euromotoelectrics.com have most if not all the parts you ever need and can ship to you within two days easily. They are amazing people through and through. Way cheaper than BMW, quality service, quality parts, BMW Tigard sucks miserably so do not go there. • Beamerboneyard.com • RealOEM.com if you need to cross reference parts or need schematics of anything on the bike • Youtube: Chris Harris. This guy is amazing, if you need any video guides on how to do pretty much any thing on the bike this guy has you covered. • Forums and communities of enthusiasts for guides and help on anything you need: Advrider.com, BMWspourttouring.com, UKgser.com, Prelicanparts.com  Anyways, if you have any other questions just ask.

Contoured for three passengers, the center seat is positioned up and forward to maximize space and comfort, and the covering is designed to resist both the elements and heavy use.LCD INSTRUMENT DISPLAY: Completely redesigned for 2022, the instrument display is much easier to read, with big, bright new graphics. The display now includes a clutch indicator and a battery-voltage readout too, in addition to speed, fuel level, RPM, transmission mode, water temperature, trip information and more.REAR-VIEW MIRROR: All our new 2022 Pioneer 1000 models feature an integral rear-view mirror mounting bracket on the rollover protection structure. The mirror itself is standard equipment on the Pioneer 1000 Trail, and an available accessory on all other trims.SOPHISTICATED CHASSIS: Some of the most impressive Pioneer 1000 features are those you’ll never see. In addition to the suspension and ground clearance, we rubber-mounted the engine and exhaust system to insulate the cabin against excessive vibration. So while you may not see this feature, it’s one you will definitely notice.TILT WHEEL: With a tilt steering wheel redesigned for 2022 to make getting in and out easier than ever, you’re ensured an even more comfortable driving experience. We’ve given the wheel a wide range of adjustments for optimum customization and a new spring-loaded damper that makes tilting it a snap.COOLER CABIN: Our engineers have given the whole Pioneer 1000 lineup some big improvements when it comes to managing cabin heat. You’ll ride cooler and be more comfortable in warm-weather conditions.ENGINEERINGi-4WD: The Pioneer 1000 Trail showcase our exclusive i-4WD system. Think “I” for “Intelligent,” because that’s exactly what it is. An industry-first brake-traction control system for side-by-sides, it simplifies operation, increases drivability and optimizes traction. Using proven, advanced technology from the Honda automotive division, you get the benefits associated with a locked front differential with none of the downsides. That means it maintains front-wheel traction even if one wheel wants to spin on ice or mud or if it’s in a hole. But at the same time, you get the lighter steering, better tracking at high speeds, tighter turning radius, and reduced kickback associated with unlocked front differentials.ADVANCED TRANSMISSION LOGIC: The brain of the DCT, Advanced Transmission Logic, senses how you drive and adapts. Relaxed drivers get earlier shifts for a quieter ride at lower engine speeds. Sportier drivers will hold each gear longer for higher RPM shifts. And when going downhill, you get true engine braking. Now that’s a smart transmission.REDESIGNED PARKING INTERLOCK: Even something like the parking brake is better on the 2022 Pioneer 1000. We’ve taken the old three-cable design and replaced it with one push/pull cable that makes adjusting easier and cuts down on servicing.HANDLINGCHASSIS AND SUSPENSION: Prepare to go further than ever before. Our refined chassis enables you to tackle terrain others would shy away from, with larger tires, long-travel independent front and rear suspension and huge ground clearance. The rubber mounted engine and exhaust system insulates against excessive vibration.OTR DIRT MASTER: All our Pioneer 1000 models for 2022 feature high-performance OTR Dirt Master tires for excellent off-road traction and superior wear.THREE DIFFERENT WHEEL CHOICES: Our four Pioneer 1000 models come with three different wheel choices. The Pioneer 1000 Trail Edition gets 14-inch black aluminum wheels with contrast-cut highlights.EPS SYSTEM: This is something we’re really proud of. Honda pioneered (no pun intended) electric power steering on our side by sides, and now we’re making it better. Every 2022 Pioneer 1000 gets a new EPS system with a new, brushless motor integrated with the ECU. The return-to-center function makes it more intuitiv on straight trails, and the whole system feels more linear.INDEPENDENT FRONT AND REAR SUSPENSION: Dual A-arm suspension gives you 10.5 inches of travel in the front, and 10-inches of travel in the rear. Pair that with stellar ground clearance, and you maximize available traction and superior comfort maneuvering over terrain other side-by-sides would shy away from.PADDLE SHIFTING: Steering column-mounted paddle shifters add a serious dose of performance in every drive. In Manual mode, they let you shift without ever taking your hands off the wheel, and in Automatic mode, they let you override the current gear with a quick up or downshift, holding that gear for several seconds before returning to Automatic mode.TURF/2WD/4WD/DIFF LOCK: Don’t tear up sensitive surfaces. Select Turf Mode. Want to access as much traction as possible? Put it in 4WD. Need maximum power at all four wheels? Lock the front and rear differentials. And the best part is, you can do it all with a shift of a single lever.PERFORMANCEMORE POWERFUL 999cc TWIN-CYLINDER ENGINE: We’ve boosted the engine power in our entire Pioneer 1000 lineup, especially in the midrange and top end. The improved acceleration and overall performance is noticeable, magnified by this year’s new lower gear ratios. Using the same Unicam® cylinder head design found in our motocross bikes, the class-leading 999cc liquid-cooled inline twin is more compact, and it still delivers the kind of horsepower and torque you’d expect from a flagship model.2500-POUND TOWING CAPACITY: Have a big load to haul? Great news for 2022—we've increased the Pioneer 1000's towing capacity to 2500 pounds. So now instead of hopping on the tractor or taking out the truck, you can stay right in your side-by-side and tackle those bigger jobs with relative ease.BUILT IN THE U.S.A.: The Pioneer 1000 is purpose-built for the American market, right in America. Domestically and globally sourced parts are all assembled at our plant in Timmonsville, South Carolina, and once these side-by-sides roll off the line, they’re ready to explore every corner of the country.FULLY-AUTOMATIC SIX-SPEED DCT TRANSMISSION: Drive the way you want, with the industry’s first and only all gear six-speed Dual Clutch Transmission. Choose between manual mode or fully automatic. Plus, the addition of Sport Mode increases the fun, shifting at higher RPM for a spirited, full-performance driving experience.HIGH/LOW SUBTRANSMISSION: With a full 42-percent gear reduction between High and Low, you get the torque you need in all six gears. It comes in handy when driving over difficult terrain, scaling steep hills or towing heavy loads.GEAR RATIOS: For 2022, all Pioneer 1000 models get new gear ratios in the transmission, subtransmission, and final drive. They help improve your Pioneer’s versatility under all driving conditions.SAFETYSAFETY NETS: We’ve upgraded the safety nets on all our Pioneer 1000 models to connect and disconnect more easily, just like on our Talon sport SxS models. We’ve changed the mesh pattern too.DRIVER/PASSENGER PROTECTION: The Occupant Protection Structure uses large-diameter tubing, and meets ISO’s rollover protection standard. The hard doors and roll-up side nets help keep debris from entering the cabin, and auto-style three-point seatbelts are equipped with an emergency locking retractor mechanism, to help optimize passenger security. When you put this much safety first, fun is sure to follow.FOUR-WHEEL DISC BRAKES: The Pioneer’s uncompromising power helps take you further than ever before. The reliable disc brakes help you stop on a dime. Built to the same standard as you’d find in our autos, the four-wheel disc brakes minimize debris from building up, ensuring consistent performance, and giving you confidence on the trail.VERSATILITYNEW FOREST AND TRAIL MODELS: New for 2022, we’re happy to announce two new Pioneer 1000 models: our Trail and Forest versions. They’re loaded with factory-installed accessories and extras, like Warn winches, special wheels, cabin lighting, special paint and graphics, and much more.1000-POUND-CAPACITY TILT BED: There are a ton of reasons to buy a Pioneer 1000. Among them: the half-ton hauling capacity*. And when it comes to dumping, we’ve made it easier than ever, with a hydraulic assist tilt bed lever that can be accessed from outside the vehicle, or right from the driver’s seat. *600-pound bed capacity for CA modelsMORE UNDERSEAT STORAGE: The Pioneer 1000’s underseat storage area is much improved for 2022. We’ve made the opening larger, which makes getting objects in and out a lot easier.BIGGER CUPHOLDERS: You asked, we listened. The primary dash-mounted cupholders in our 2022 Pioneer 1000 models are upsized this year, and big enough to hold the most popular insulated tumblers. Plus, all Pioneer 1000 models also feature cup holders in every door. Designed to hold your water bottles securely, it’s a convenient touch everyone will appreciate.UNDER-DASH STORAGE: Standard equipment on the Pioneer 1000 Trail, and as an available accessory on the Pioneer 1000, this practical under-dash shelf keeps frequently used items right up front in the cab.WARN VRX 45 WINCH: This is a huge upgrade and standard equipment on our Pioneer 1000 Trail models. The winch is installed at the factory, and is built right into the Pioneer’s chassis, not added on as an accessory. With a 4500-pound capacity and spooled with steel cable, you’ll be ready to pull your buddy out when he gets stuck!ACCESSORY SWITCH PANEL: Standard equipment on the 2022 Pioneer 1000 Trail, the switch panel has room for seven switches, letting you control things like a winch, accessory lights, and more. A fully integrated design, it sits in the center of the dashboard, underneath the other switches and controls.12-VOLT ACCESSORY SOCKET: The Pioneer 1000 Trail all feature a standard 12-volt power socket in the bed. Using a common “cigarette-lighter” style of outlet, it’s perfect for powering things like a spotlight, work light, sprayer, air compressor, 110-volt inverter and more.INTERIOR LIGHT: Our new 2022 Pioneer 1000 Trail come with an interior light that lights up the floor area of the cabin., It’s convenient, and a big help illuminating the under-dash storage area so you can find your items in low-light conditions.ENGINE AIR INTAKE: To get the most out of your engine, you need the best air going into it. That’s why we positioned the air intake up high under the hood. It helps ensure a clean air supply, even at deeper fording depths, and with a viscous air filter element, you get increased performance and longer service intervals.Call California Custom Trailers & Powersports at (805) 227-4665 2340 PROSPECT AVE, STE 105, PASO ROBLES, CA 93446   Or online at www.calcustompaso.com (MSRP = Manufacture Suggested Retail Price and does not Include   Factory Freight, Documentation, DMV, Ca Tire Recycling, and Sales   Tax) Current Financing available with little to no down payment OAC. Honda Pioneer, pioneer, 4x4, sxs, side by side, utility",,,,,,,,,,

""Motorcycle Art""..... Super fun canyon-carving machine for those who remember the word ""gnarly"" with fondness. This thing growls like a Pitbull, and yes, it will bite you if you're not careful.  Torquey motor with a crazy 12,000 RPM redline, and it gets there shockingly quick. The bike is 464 lbs. wet. Snappy... If it weren't for the cupped seat you'd often find yourself sitting in the street, wondering what just happened.  Has all the delicious 910R carbon fiber bits. Lovely. In 2006 you had to pay a $3,500 premium to get a bike with all the carbon parts.  Fat 50mm Marzocchi adjustable forks. Adjustable Sachs rear shock with adjustable spring preload. Six piston calipers in front. Four piston caliper in back. Adjustable foot controls and levers (so yes, if you're not switching from a Road King, you almost certainly can make this bike fit you like a pair of custom Italian loafers). This bike goes fast, it's comfortable and stops fast. A rare, beautiful alternative to Ducati Monster, Diavel, Yamaha Z1 and other common naked style bikes.... thanks to mister Tamburini. Ciao Bella!

Frame was ridden about 3500 miles,  dry (no rain) between 2014- early '16 .  Never crashed.  Harder to find bold white letters with the Green graphics.  Solid Road riding , or can also double as a TT bike (very aero).    Frame still has a lifetime warranty , but I can speak with a prospective buyer on this in more detail in person /over the phone.  Some specifics on frame : * 56cm top tube length ,  traditional (not effective TT length) sizing.  Usually a good fit if you're between 5'10- 6' * 3k carbon fiber weave,  High Modulus  , made in Taiwan * fork is full carbon , aero * seatpost is tear dropped , full carbon , proprietary .  * frame/fork/seatpost / headset weight, is right about  4.25 lbs.  Not too light, it puts the frame weight at around 3lbs which is good , and from my experience carbon frames weighing 2.5- 3.25 lbs (Colnago C40-50 , Calfee frames, LOOK, Kestral monocoque )  tend to be durable over 40-50k miles.   Frames that are about 1.8- low 2.2 lbs tend to be race frames, and not so durable.  Here is Felt's catalog history online, to look up AR bikes:  https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0021/5701/9254/files/2011_Performance_Catalog.pdf?620  In speaking to a Felt CSR on the phone, the only difference between a AR1 and a AR5 is that a AR1 will be slightly more stiff, and weigh slightly less( not sure how many ounces less, probably 3-6 oz) in regards to their FRD production process.  They're both made in the same facility in Taiwan, have the same general design, and 3K weave.   It could be said like how Santa Cruz makes their carbon frames in China, that the ""lower level"" carbon frame tends to exhibit more vertical compliance (shock absorption value) to the rider, and tends to be a bit more durable then the higher grade (stiffer) carbon frames.  It's currently built up, so a prospective buyer can at least test ride it.  It would only take me 1 hr to disassemble to Frame/fork/HS/seatpost. My price is fairly firm.  I believe MSRP was right around $2000-2200 for the frameset .     If interested, please message me here, for further info , and to exchange further contact info",,,,,,,,,,

Here is a glimpse at just the top ten uses of utility trailers:  1.Automobiles: From time to time it becomes necessary to haul an inoperable car or truck. Tow trucks are expensive, especially if the distance is great. A utility trailer is a great way to haul vehicles and a good investment if you need to do so regularly.  2.Boats: If you have a boat, you will need a utility trailer to get it to and from the water.  3.Lawn Care Equipment: If you live in a rural area, you may find that you need to haul your mowing equipment from one piece of your property to another. Packing equipment and loading it into a pickup truck bed can get old very quickly. A utility trailer will allow you to drive your equipment right up onto the trailer without the aid of ramps or two strong men.  4.Furniture: Moving furniture is a breeze with a utility trailer. Furniture dollies roll right up onto the trailer and you can haul more than you can with a pickup.  5.Building Supplies: Do you have projects that need to be done around the house? Pick up your own building supplies and save on delivery fees.  6.Bikes, Motorcycles, and ATVs: Recreational vehicles are best hauled on a utility trailer.  7.Livestock: An enclosed utility trailer is most often used to haul livestock.  8.Auction and Flea Markets: If you frequent auctions and flea markets, you will need the hauling capability to bring home your inexpensive and rare finds.  9.Appliances: Utility trailers are ideal for hauling appliances.  10.Debris and Trash: Loading trash in and out of your pickup bed can be cumbersome and clean up can be messy, but it would be worse to have to haul trash in your SUV. Clean up after a big job is a lot easier with a utility trailer.  As you can see, there are many reasons why an investment in a utility trailer is a smart move. I'm sure that with a little time, and its easy availability, you will come up with even more ways to use a trailer  ATV UTV SXS MOTORCYCLE BIKE TRANSPORT HAUL MOVE CAR TRUCK MOVING TRAVELING STORAGE CARGO LOADS AUTHORITY BOAT HAULING BUSINESS BUSINESS FOR SALE JOB SALES CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT STEEL RAZOR SNOWMOBILE POLARIS YAHAMA WILD CAT MACHINE AUTOMOBILE AUTO VAN TOWING TOW VECHICLE SNOW RAIN BOX TRUCK FLATBED GOOSNECK BUMPER PULL HITCH BALL WEATHER BUY WOOD Westchester County, NY Amawalk, Annsville, Archville, Ardsley, Ardsley-on-Hudson, Armawalk, Armonk, Arthur Manor, Banksville, Bayberry Park, Bedford, Bedford Center, Bedford Hills, Beech Hill, Beechmont, Beechmont Woods, Bonnie Crest, Boutonville, Briarcliff Manor, Bronxville, Bronxville Heights, Bryn Mawr Park, Buchanan, Buckhout Corners, Butlerville, Cecil Park, Cedar Knolls, Chappaqua, Chauncey, Chester Hill Park, Chimney Corners, Colonial Acres, Colonial Heights, Crestwood, Crestwood Gardens, Crompond, Cross River, Croton Falls, Croton Heights, Croton-on-Hudson, Crotonville, Crugers, Dobbs Ferry, Dunwoodie, Dunwoodie Heights, East Irvington, East White Plains, East Woods, Eastchester, Eastview, Elmsford, Elmsmere, Fairview, Fleetwood, Forest Knolls, Fox Meadow, Furnace Woods, Gallows Hill, Glendale, Glenville, Glenwood, Goldens Bridge, Graham, Granite Springs, Grant Corner, Greenhaven, Greenville, Grey Oaks, Greystone, Gunther Park, Harrison, Hartsdale, Hastings-on-Hudson, Hawthorne, Heath Ridge, Heathcote, Heritage Hills, Homestead Park, Horseshoe Hill, Horton Estates, Huguenot Park, Irvington, Isle of San Souci, Jefferson Valley, Katonah, Kitchawan, Lake Katonah, Lake Lincolndale, Lake Mohegan, Lake Purdy, Larchmont, Lawrence Park, Lewisboro, Lincoln, Lincolndale, Lowerre, Ludlow, Mamaroneck, Maplewood, Mariandale, Millwood, Milton, Mohegan Heights, Mohegan Lake, Montrose, Mount Airy, Mount Hope, Mount Kisco, Mount Pleasant, Mount Vernon, Murdock Woods, Murray Hill, Nepera Park, Nepperhan, New Rochelle, North Salem, North White Plains, Oceola Lake, Orienta, Oscawana, Ossining, Park Hill, Parkside, Peekskill, Pelham, Pelham Manor, Philipse Manor, Pinebrook, Pinebrook Heights, Pleasantside, Pleasantville, Pocantico Hills, Port Chester, Pound Ridge, Purchase, Purdys, Purdys Grove, Quaker Ridge, Quarry Heights, Residence Park, Ridgeway, Rochelle Heights, Rochelle Park, Roe Park, Rosedale, Rye, Rye Brook, Salem Center, Sarles Corners, Scarborough, Scarsdale, Scarsdale Downs, Scarsdale Park, Scotts Corners, Secor Gardens, Shenorock, Sherman Park, Shore Acres, Shrub Oak, Sleepy Hollow, Sleepy Hollow Manor, Somers, South Salem, Sparta, Spring Valley, Stanwood, Sun Haven, Sunny Brae, Tarrytown, Thornwood, Toddville, Tompkins Corners, Tuckahoe, Twin Lakes Village, Valhalla, Valley Pond Estates, Van Cortlandtville, Vernon Park, Verplanck, Victory Park, Vista, Waccabuc, Waverly, West Mount Vernon, White Birches, White Plains, Whitehall Corners, Wilmot Woods, Windmill Farm, Woodlands, Woodybrook, Worthington, Wykagyl, Wykagyl Park, Yonkers, Yorktown, Yorktown Heights, brooklyn, queens, manhattan, nyc, bronx, staten island, long island, hudson valley",,,,,,,,,,

Spinner® Sport Spin Bike (Indoor Cycle) Review Spinner® Sport, the original design for home spinning bikes, has proven to be an excellent design for indoor cycling, serious indoor training and workouts and the Spinner® Sport Bike is a good low cost choice for this type of fitness bike.   Indoor cycles or spinning bikes, such as the Spinner® Sport by Spinner, are upright exercise bikes that are mostly mechanical, use friction based resistance mechanisms and provide easy access to unlimited resistance levels.   Note: The Spinner® Sport Indoor Cycle is  (was selling at for $499 at Wal-mart, with FREE shipping options).  Please see our Exercise Bike Ratings page for the latest fitness bikes that are available online.   Customer Reviews:  1. I had a chance to test the Spinner® Sport recently and this is a solid, no frills fitness bike that can be easily adjusted to any level of workout. As with most indoor cycles, you simply adjust the resistance level with a simple turn of the resistance knob above the wheel. At the time of this review, the overall review at Amazon (for example) was 4 out of 5 stars, from 19 reviews.   2.  ""This bike is sturdy, smooth, and delivers a strong ride. I was completely surprised!..."" 'It delivers the exact workout that I want, and it's built really well. I would suggest it to anyone looking for the spinning workout at home, and I believe that it's a good buy for its price range.",, excellent,,,,,,,,

Stunningly beautiful.Very nice vintage rider. Outstanding condition for Eroica events. All Campy right down to the water bottle cage and Aero bottle, cable housings and even the cables….even the little cable clamps are Campy Nuovo Record.  I am including 2 free wheels, The wood rack where it is displayed in my house if you want to store it indoors between rides rather than in your garage, The toe clip style shoes, the string back gloves and the cycling cap. I will also include some specialty tools for vintage bikes (see photo) that are hard to find these days. The right tool makes working on it easy.  Alan started making aluminum bikes in 1972. They were the first Alu bikes, 10 years ahead of Cannondale. They used a patented process by which they used cast aluminum lugs with threaded tubes. When the tubes are threaded into the lugs they are also bonded with aerospace adhesive. The results are a very stout frame. No welds to break. Check out the web site story online. These bikes were raced all around the world by many different race teams.  The size is a 56-57 cm. The bike was written by a person who is 5‘10“ as well as a person who is 6‘0“. It fit us both just fine. Bike was taken out of service 20 years ago and placed on display as an art piece in my house. That’s why it is so pristine.    Founded in 1972 by Lodovico Falconi, an engineer who had worked for Torpado. The ALAN brand became one of  the most successful makers of aluminum bicycles, virtually dominating the top ranks of cyclocross for 20 years and providing pro rides on the road as well. ALAN also supplied frames for other labels including COLNAGO, GUERCIOTTI, FABO and others.    ALAN has a reputation for structural integrity, due to their unique system of threading the tube and lug joints, making both a mechanical and bonded connection, referred to as ""Glued and Screwed.""  From the makers 1975 sales literature: The Alan Super Record Frame set         The Super Record represents the latest development of the Alan aluminum alloy frame from Italy. This frame utilizes a unique patented construction system of threaded tubing and lugs joined with epoxy adhesive. Thus it is not brazed or welded. The Super Record includes the following refinements:  1. The use of increased tubing wall thickness (2 mm) gives this frame a much stiffer ride and more efficient transmission of power than the standard Alan Competition model.  2. The redesigned fork with larger, beefier blades, new crown and ergal stabilizer adds to front end stiffness and makes the handling extremely positive.  3. The improved seat cluster has an integral stay connector for extra strength and appearance.  4. The frame is detailed with bottle cage fittings, shift level bosses, bottom bracket cable guides and dynamic cutouts in the lugs and fork crown.", caliper, like new, drop, none (rigid), none,,,,,
