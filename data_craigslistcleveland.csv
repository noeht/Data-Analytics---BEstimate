The rear hub is a flip-flop, however, the bike is set up fixed.   The upgrades significantly help with the usability and comfort of the bike. The carbon fiber riser bars – coupled with the tires -- help to soak up the vibrations that are common with skinny tire steel-bar track bikes. Additionally, the mountain bike bars have been chopped to narrow the overall silhouette of the bike. The overall running position is now much more comfortable yet still sporty. The Paul Components brake lever helps maintain the clean lines of the cockpit while still offering the safety of a brake!

This ROSS Eurotour is all original, right down to the seat, bars, grips, brakes, cables, paint, reflectors and even the 27"" tires! The tires are old and dry rotted, but they still hold air and ride great! The fenders have some rust but are solid and could be restored (or ignored, or removed).  Everything works like it should, because they built them right, back then. Don't miss out on this rare chance to own and enjoy the quality of days gone. Or, you may end up flushing your $ down the toilet with the Walmart bikes you see on the curb every week for trash pickup.  If you see this ad the bike is still available.

Appears mostly complete but definitely missing a few pieces. -Pacer Moped. Two seater (two riders on a moped is illegal in Ohio) unknown condition but mostly complete. -Vespa Piaggio Grande. Incomplete. Has frame, front fork/tire, peddles...see pics. -throwing in all of my extra moped parts and pieces. Lots of upgrade stuff. Foot pegs, mirrors, headlight screens, various handle bars and seats, new chain, green light magnets, a fork lock a speedometer and a high performance Homoet muffler, mud flaps, wind shield and more.  The rarity of the Pryor Trike makes this a super unique lot. Youre unlikely to find another for sale...anywhere. They were made in Ohio and won awards for their patended differential. This bike has custom wood floorboards and trunk. The trike was never quite the fastest moped in my collection but it is the funniest to ride and super reliable. It also easily hauls a cooler! The Sachs 5 Star General Top Tank is one of the most sought after bikes by moped enthusiasts. With a bit of wrenching, this will be well worth my entire lot's asking price on it's own. Dont believe me? Do a quick price check on these mopeds. Feel free to ask any questions, I'm not a mechanic but I'll try to answer and I'll be as honest as possible w my limited knowledge. Gas prices are way up but mopeds are extremely fuel efficient. Pick up at my warehouse garage downtown Cleveland.
