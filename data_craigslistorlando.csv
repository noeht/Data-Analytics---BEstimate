The wheel size is 29inches.  I bought the bike last year for $5,000 plus tax. I’m retired and live in the Villages. I’ve only used the bike to ride on the paved trails here in the Villages and I’ve never ridden in the rain. Because of hip pain I bought a shorter crankset. I also replaced the handlebar with one that raises the hand position about an inch. I had the bike shop put on street tires to quiet the noise the off-road tires made. I installed a pair of $700 power meter pedals, a Garmin bike computer mount, mud flap for the front tire, ergonomic grips, new chain because I also installed a bigger chain ring, rearview mirror, top tube tool pouch and I replaced the factory seat with a Bontrager seat that does not go with the bike. The sale will also include two new inner tubes just in case you decide to go back to tubes. The wheels are setup as tubeless right now.   The pictures show dirt under the down tube which is also protected with a clear pain protection film. I don’t see any paint chips or scratches on the bike. If it was cleaned up it would look brand new. I don’t ride the bike with the suspension “unlocked” so the suspension hasn’t been abused.   The bike weighs about 25lbs   Here’s the Trek website link for the specs on the bike,  https://www.trekbikes.com/international/en_IN_TL/bikes/mountain-bikes/cross-country-mountain-bikes/supercaliber/supercaliber-9-7/p/28588/  I’ve got about $7,000 in the bike with the power meter pedals, tires, second set of pedals, tool pouch, extra tubes, new cranks with factory chainring and other accessories. Asking $4,900 for everything. Given the bike shortage and parts shortage this is a fair price for a lightly used bike.   If the ad is up it’s still for sale.   Not interested in parting out the bike or shipping it to your family member for a fake check. Cash only.  I prefer a text message to begin the purchase process. I live in the new section of the Villages south of the turnpike and cannot bring the bike to you as I don’t own a car.

The frame design called a Mixte, from the French word meaning ""mixed"" or ""unisex"". Was popular with quality European bicycle manufacturers; Peugeot, Gitane, Raleigh, Bianchi, and others. This classic design has made a comeback and is the new trend in stylish city bikes. It’s also popular with niche bicycle manufacturers and collectors.   This particular Mixte is rare because it was made in Japan by OMNI Bicycle Company.  Have you ever seen another OMNI bicycle from Japan? Japan was home of quality bicycle manufacturing in the 70s and 80s when Japan manufacturers Panasonic and Myiata hand-built lightweight, triple butted, lugged, Chromoly steel frames. Many were re-badged by other Japan manufacturers. I suspect that is the case with the OMNI Bicycle Company and this rare ""LA.BIKE"".    Buy this bicycle or different bike, but the idea is to get outside and ride for FUN and your good health.   Specs: •	SEITETSU Hi-Tensile seamless tubing frame and fork  •	Chrome handlebars and rims  •	Suntour components   •	Araya Wheels    •	Brand new, period correct Kenda 27 x 1 1/4 gumwall road tires and tubes   •	Rides like new  •	Comfortable upright ride position  •	Shifts smoothly  •	Stops Great   •	Cables appear to be original and in great condition  •	Original saddle is soft with no rips or blemishes    This is a 40 year-old bicycle in beautiful un-restored survivor condition with minor paint blemishes.

This vintage 12 speed OMNI ""LA.BIKE"" is from an era of quality hand-built lightweight lugged steel frame bikes of the 1970s and 80s. The frame design called a Mixte, from the French word meaning ""mixed"" or ""unisex"", was popular with quality European bicycle companies, Peugeot, Gitane, Raleigh, Bianchi, and others. Now this classic design with its swept back handlebars is making a comeback with niche bicycle manufacturers and collectors.  This particular Mixte is rare because it was made in Japan by the OMNI Bicycle Company.  Have you ever seen another OMNI bicycle from Japan? Japan was home of quality bicycle manufacturing in the 70s and 80s when Japan manufacturers Panasonic and Myiata hand-built lightweight, triple butted, lugged, Chromoly steel frames. Many were contracted by other bicycle manufacturers and re-badged. I suspect that is the case with this OMNI ""LA.BIKE"".  Buy this bicycle or different bike, but the idea is to get outside and ride for FUN and good health. Specs: •	SEITETSU Hi-Tensile seamless tubing frame and fork •	Chrome handlebars and rims •	Suntour components  •	Araya Wheels   •	Brand new, period correct Kenda 27 x 1 1/4 gumwall road tires and tubes  •	Rides like new •	Comfortable upright ride position, fits a rider 5'3"" - 5'10 by adjusting the seat •	Shifts smoothly •	Stops as it should  •	Cables appear to be original and in excellent condition Ride it, restore it, or display this unique classic as is with its patina of a 40 year old bicycle.  To avoid spam, contact must be via Craigslist email or leave me a voice message so I can call you back. No texting, this is a landline.  PH: 4-zero-7-3-two-7-2740 I will accept $350 cash only.
