We are also buying, selling and trading all manner of quality bicycle, but we are particularly focused on the brands we carry as new bikes like Surly, Salsa, All-City, Bianchi, Linus, SE, etc.  We are a bike store, have listed in the business section and paid the Craigslist fees accordingly.  We accept trade-ins.   All of our used and new bikes are warrantied. We warranty the used bikes ourselves for 60 days against everything including flat tires. The new bikes have the full factory warranty from manufacturer as we are authorized dealers.   You can see all the kids bikes that we currently have here - https://cocosvariety.com/collections/kids-bikes  Sign up for the Bike Alert! Email. We send whenever we have fresh inventory of new or used bikes.   +++++++++++++++++++++++++  Used woom 3 - Green - $350  Well kept and fully tuned by Coco's. Some scuffs and scraps, but very presentable for a kid learning to ride.   woom 3 - 16"" wheels - Ages  4 - 6  +++++++++++++++++++++++++  Used woom 3 - Red - $350  Well kept and fully tuned by Coco's. Some scuffs and scraps, but very presentable for a kid learning to ride.   woom 3 - 16"" wheels - Ages  4 - 6  We were a woom dealer and sold 100's of woom bicycles. When the demand skyrocketed during the pandemic, woom discontinued their small dealer network. We were the only dealer in Southern California. As such, we get a fair number of woom bikes as trade-ins.   +++++++++++++++++++++++++  Used Cleary Owl 20"" - Pink    Well kept, stored inside, little scratches here and there. Cleary is one of the premoer kid's bike manufacturers.  20"" New $430 (we have new Cleary Owls too) Used $350    +++++++++++++++++++++++++  Brand New Evo 24"" and 20"" Mountain Bikes   We have brand new Evo kid's bikes in stock in 20"" and 24"" sizes. Evo is a Euro brand thus the much lower level of graphics and such.  We like them as a lot of kid's bikes like these come with suspension forks which are generally not of high quality, not needed and weigh a lot more. In this configuration, you can ride some dirt, then later, if you are mostly road riding, change to a narrower slink tire.  24"" in mint (as seen) or black 20"" in red  Nice price for quality 7 speed bikes 24"" - $349 - 7 Speed  20"" - $299 - Single speed  +++++++++++++++++++++++++  New Cleary Bikes - Many colors, spec and sizes  We have 20 Cleary bikes in stock. At this time we only have new Clearys in sizes from 16"" -  26"". We believe that the Cleary is the best all around kids bike. The internal 3 and 5 speed hubs are so superior for kids than a derailleur that always get knock out of adjustment. The standard threadless stem set-up like on nice adult bikes means you can replace with longer stem as child ages and get another year or two out of the bike before outgrowing.   You can see the bikes here - https://cocosvariety.com/collections/kids-bikes   +++++++++++++++++++++++++  Used Diamondback 20"" Mountain Bike - Orange   20"" bike, 1 x 6 gripshift, suspension fork, v-brake.  This is a little lower end than we usually sell - more of a Dick's Sporting Goods brand as opposed to a true bike store brand like Giant or Specialized. The bike is of fine quality but it is very heavy.   20"" wheel  Typically 6-9 years old, depending on the child. $100  +++++++++++++++++++++++++  Used Linus 16"" Roadster Blue with training wheels  Some scuffs and scraps but overall this bike is in nice condition. Less than half the price of new Linus 16""s which have reached an astonishing $369 for new ones.  16"" wheel Fits most riders ages 4 to 6 $160  +++++++++++++++++++++++++  Used Linus Lil Roadster in terrific condition. Blue with no training wheels  The most minor flaws distinguish it from a brand new bicycles.   20"" Wheel Typically 6-9 years old, depending on the child. $275   +++++++++++++++++++++++++  Giant Animator 16"" - Blue and White with training wheels  Clean condition! Was kept inside and it shows. Near new.  Small 16"" wheel Generally ages 4-6 $175  +++++++++++++++++++++++++  Used Fuji 20"" Performance Bike - Orange and White  Rare bike! It is a hard to find a kid's bike with the  features of an adult performance hybrid like narrow double wall rims, presta valves, threadless headset, dual pivot brakes, et al.  Ages 7 - 9 $250  +++++++++++++++++++++++++  +++++++++++++++++++++++++   After 14 years of Coco's being open 7 days a week, we have ceased having regular business hours and now people need to call to visit. We are still here 11-6 daily, closed Sundays, so just give us a call to come by and check out the scene.  Coco's buys, sells and trades new and used, vintage and modern bicycles.  Additionally, we are interested in fine art, pottery, early California, vintage automobiles, antiques, old electronics like ancient Apple Computers and vintage hi-if, 4 wheel drive adventure gear, books, records, CDs, tapes, watches and tools so we are always open to interesting trades. Our robust want list resides here - https://cocosvariety.com/pages/want-list  If you are interested in what Coco's Variety is up to, we have two newsletters.  Bike Alert! Newsletter - every bike we get, all fresh inventory, used and new, goes to the Bike Alert! first. Dispatch from the Edge's of the Coco's Variety Universe - more broad, some bikes, some cars, some garage sale reports  Subscribe to either or both here - https://cocosvariety.com/pages/newsletter-sign-up  This is not all the bikes we have. Check the website for more offerings. Cocosvariety.com  Our prices are firm and unfortunately we do need to charge sales tax. Trade-ins welcome. Credit cards ok.

I am now applying my model and inventory to providing GREAT TEAM BUILDING EXPERIENCES and/or Corporate Events in SPIN CLASSES / RIDES - which include among the best spinning instructors in the industry!!!  In the physically and mentally fulfilling group exercise environment, all that is involved includes: staying in sync; keeping up with one another; going out on an adventure; relinquishing and trusting the lead of someone else; pulling out one's own 'best game' and pushing themselves beyond comfort boundaries; putting everyone on the same playing field; it's fun, energetic, gets endorphins kicking in... and, its centered around wellness (physically; mentally; spiritually)!   To the point - it got me thinking about exploring getting into the team-building / corporate event space... as I am in an opportune and great position to team up with organizations such as Best Corporate Events to offer spin classes (as I have the fleet of bikes; the access to the top instructors in the industry; can travel / deliver bikes around the US; and, have great ideas for this sort of activity that can be incorporated into your already successful and influential program(s)).    Nonetheless... I wanted to let you know I was out here now in this space and if this was something that you could incorporate into one of the several activities you incorporate into your program, I believe there's a lot that can be achieved with this activity for teams (of all sizes)!

The agile RM-Z250 combines the sleek, race-ready appearance of the RM-Z450 with a versatile engine and responsive chassis to deliver superior performance. Using Suzuki's RUN, TURN, and STOP philosophy, factory engineers have made the RM-Z250 a formidable competitor.The RM-Z250 has always set the standard as the best handling 250 on the track. Fed by a dual injector EFI system, a center-port cylinder head and an AMA-compliant exhaust, the RM-Z250's engine delivers strong, usable power through the entire rev-range.The twin-spar aluminum frame and hydro-formed swingarm carry a KYB-supplied suspension that includes a coil spring fork and a shock with four-way damping force adjustment. Strong brakes and ergonomically shaped bodywork help keep the rider in control as the RM-Z250 carves up the racetrack.Tuning the fuel injection and ignition for maximum performance is easy thanks to Suzuki's smartphone-based MX-Tuner and proven fuel-coupler system. Suzuki's Winning Balance is on display with the 2022 RM-Z250 as it maintains its own high standard for cornering performance.Features may include:ENGINEFitted with a center-port cylinder head, the fuel-injected, 249cc, liquid-cooled, four-stroke, four-valve, DOHC engine remains proven and reliable.The engine delivers strong peak power and superb throttle response through the entire rev range.The cylinder head features a refined intake port shape and finish that fine-tunes the fuel/air charge into the combustion chamber to increase engine output.TRANSMISSION & DRIVEThe five-speed transmission's second gear ratio and overall final ratio matches the engine's stronger output for outstanding acceleration and top speed.True to Suzuki transmission standards, the gear shift operation is smooth and precise. Carefully designed parts like the precisely machined shift cam and corresponding gears create a transmission a racer can rely on.The multi-plate, wet-clutch uses a rack-and-pinion clutch release mechanism for precise feel of the engagement and disengagement points while riding.CHASSISThe RM-Z250 features a frame and swingarm design that continues Suzuki's reputation for creating the best-handling motocross motorcycles.The aluminum alloy, twin-spar frame combines cast and extruded sections to achieve superior front-and-rear weight distribution, while balancing strength and weight.The 2022 RM-Z250 frame is 370 grams (0.8 pounds) lighter but has a 10 percent increase in torsional rigidity as compared to the prior generation frame.The engine's position in the frame is rotated up so the crankshaft sits higher in the chassis to further the bike's nimble handling characteristics.The rear, upper engine mounts are outboard of the cylinder head to increase rigidity and allow a direct intake path to the engine.The engine mount material is changed to aluminum, rather than steel, for reduced weight.The swingarm is shaped using an innovative hydroforming process that maintains strength but weighs 0.6 pounds (270 grams).

This rad little ride has a sweet ""big kid"" look, thanks to the laser-printed seat, gnarly p-wrap chain guard and a fun handlebar number plate. Since fit is key, the Piston features all new Schwinn SmartStart geometry, a complete redesign of bike geometry that matches a kid's body type to create a more comfortable, ideal riding position. This includes a lighter bike frame for added control, smaller grip handles to match smaller hands, and a more narrow pedal position to match narrow kid hips! Other kids bikes are just shrunken down versions of adult bikes, so typically the grips are too large, the pedals too wide, and the seats are too big. Thanks to the tool-free adjustable seat post, your child won't need a new bike after their next growth spurt.",aluminum,kids,unknown,excellent,0.0,medium,unknown,0.0,0.0,16,1.0,0,0,0,0,4

Our Samson MID DRIVES start at $2449 and range up to $2649 based on frame and battery choice. The ORION is a purpose built hunting bike that will literally climb a mountain to get that illusive elk. The long list of upgrades includes full suspension, hydraulic brakes, 1650 watts of power, and a 52 volt, 20 AH battery...The list goes on, and on. These are very well suited for off road riders, hunters, beach riders, or anyone who loves a ton of power. The Samson Mid Drives are not your everyday Ebike. Unlike the usual ""Amazon bike"" or some local flavor, These are built to put out a lot of power. They are designed to climb hills, travel fast for commuting, or excel at beach riding. We use a 48 or 52 volt 20 AH battery for outstanding range. Many SAMSON HD riders say they are getting in excess of 50 miles with normal, everyday riding. Most bikes can come with fenders, racks, lights, and many other accessories. We also offer some bikes that are more suited for street use such as ""RADIUS,"" our street bike or ""Northwest Fox,"" our recumbent electric bike. Both come with the powerful BAFANG 750 mid drive.

Our Samson MID DRIVES start at $2549 for the red Samson 2.0, and range up to $2749 for the charchoal Samson HD. Starting at $2849, The ORION is a purpose built hunting bike that will literally climb a mountain to get that illusive elk. The long list of available upgrades includes full suspension, hydraulic brakes, 1650 watts of power, and a 52 volt, 20 AH battery...The list goes on, and on. These are very well suited for off road riders, hunters, beach riders, or anyone who loves a ton of power on the street. The Samson Mid Drives are not your everyday Ebike. Unlike the usual ""Budget Amazon bike"" or some local flavor, These are built to put out a lot of power AND consistently travel 50+ miles per charge. They are designed to climb hills, travel fast for commuting, or excel at beach riding. We use a 48 or 52 volt 20 AH battery for outstanding range. Some riders say they are getting in excess of 50 miles with a 1000 watt Samson. Most bikes can come with fenders, racks, lights, and many other accessories. We also offer some bikes that are more suited for street use such as ""RADIUS,"" our street bike or ""Northwest Fox,"" our recumbent electric bike. We also offer trikes, both standard and fat tire. Delivery is free within 100 miles of Albany, OR! It is also same or next day on most bikes. Please call show 541-905-seven486 .

The rebuild included several modifications that are debatably factory due to the fact that I hunted and picked through the bone yard to pull the very best K0 camshaft, cam towers, rockers, shafts, etc. I pieced each together utilizing the best of each year of the 750 to maximize the power output “WITHOUT” increasing displacement. Essentially this bike has been gone through with power in mind, but I have not bored it out. Rather old parts have been replaced with either new stock sizes or lightly used parts. Everything and I mean EVERYTHING in the top end has been hand lightened, the head completely ported and polished, including combustion chambers, as well as domed (higher compression) pistons installed.  	⁃	All electrical parts have been gone through with the points replaced, then essentially bypassed with a transistorized ignition, new coils, upgraded advance unit, modified advance springs, and so on. All in all everything is LED and the headlight alone is amazing to say the least. The electrical upgrades completely removed the 750 flat spot in the mid range and have overall reduced the workload that the wiring has to deal with. All of this improves reliability, performance, and safety.  	⁃	The tires alone are over $500 in rubber and MAN do they hug the corners. 	⁃	The suspension has been completely gone through, with fork seals and oil replaced. The triple tree clamps cracked on me on my way to work one day, so I bought a joker machine replacement set that are solid billet aluminum with taper steering stem bearings installed. 	⁃	The front and rear wheels have been professionally trued and bearing have been replaced with the tires at end of last riding season.  	⁃	The front wheels hub does not come stock setup to be able to receive a second (yes that’s right second, as in dual disk) disk, but I have machined the hub and have the second disk on the front wheel now. I also have the second brake setup complete, but you would just need to get the brake line for it. Cool part about the triple clamp is that it actually acts as the hydraulic splitter for the front end. So everything is set to go, I just never got around to getting it done.  	⁃	There are two completely different set of pipes based on your preference. One is an after market 4 into 1 that is on it now. I personally don’t like or prefer this set, but haven’t had the time to swap them back to the original 4 into 4 chrome pipes. With all of the upgrades done to bike I thought it might do well with the 4 into 1 pipe, but honestly have been disappointed. The performance, sound, and look of the originals far out way the 4 into 1 set. Both come with the bike though.   I could go on and on about this bike if you couldn’t tell, but sadly a “deal with the devil”, just kidding a deal with my wife is causing me to have to give this prize up. Lame or stupid as I may sound I REALLY REALLY want this bike to go to someone who will love it the way that I have. Give it a good home if you will. The trick with “old” bikes is that they need a certain amount of care and most people don’t get that. They just ride it and don’t take care of what they have. Really the only thing that hasn’t been updated in this bike is it’s cosmetics. The tank has a small ding and a scratch, but the seat, tank, and side panels are all from the 70’s. Quality stuff really.  I also have two full bins chalk full of parts for this baby. I am happy to include most of them.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,0.0,unknown,unknown,0.0,0.0,unknown,0.0,0,0,0,0,6

Ridden for one season. Rips through most everything and has fun doing it. I'm just looking to find something with a little more travel.   RideWrap (frame protection) installed on day 1, pedals and cage can be included if you want. A few tiny paint chips on the chainstays and right brake lever, and fork decal scratches, as is expected. Rear rim has a small bulge (0.5"" long) on the right side that does not affect performance. This damage is reflected in the price.  Will be sold with stock Burgtec aluminum bars.   Everything stock, except upgraded the rear tire with a double down DHR II and brake pads to SRAM performance.  Servicing the fork this week.  Happy to send more photos and answer questions.

I know the label on the batteries says they are 20000 mAh, but that's not true - just a fake value from the distributor.  The motor is a 48v, 1500w hub motor, which I have over-volted to 60v for greater top speed.  The top speed of the bike is about 25 mph, and the range is about 10 miles. Not a ton of range, but good for quick trips around town.  Feel free to reach out with any questions! I accept cash and Venmo - no trades. Text only, and I'm open to offers.

Here is a glimpse at just the top ten uses of utility trailers:  1.Automobiles: From time to time it becomes necessary to haul an inoperable car or truck. Tow trucks are expensive, especially if the distance is great. A utility trailer is a great way to haul vehicles and a good investment if you need to do so regularly.  2.Boats: If you have a boat, you will need a utility trailer to get it to and from the water.  3.Lawn Care Equipment: If you live in a rural area, you may find that you need to haul your mowing equipment from one piece of your property to another. Packing equipment and loading it into a pickup truck bed can get old very quickly. A utility trailer will allow you to drive your equipment right up onto the trailer without the aid of ramps or two strong men.  4.Furniture: Moving furniture is a breeze with a utility trailer. Furniture dollies roll right up onto the trailer and you can haul more than you can with a pickup.  5.Building Supplies: Do you have projects that need to be done around the house? Pick up your own building supplies and save on delivery fees.  6.Bikes, Motorcycles, and ATVs: Recreational vehicles are best hauled on a utility trailer.  7.Livestock: An enclosed utility trailer is most often used to haul livestock.  8.Auction and Flea Markets: If you frequent auctions and flea markets, you will need the hauling capability to bring home your inexpensive and rare finds.  9.Appliances: Utility trailers are ideal for hauling appliances.  10.Debris and Trash: Loading trash in and out of your pickup bed can be cumbersome and clean up can be messy, but it would be worse to have to haul trash in your SUV. Clean up after a big job is a lot easier with a utility trailer.  As you can see, there are many reasons why an investment in a utility trailer is a smart move. I'm sure that with a little time, and its easy availability, you will come up with even more ways to use a trailer  ATV UTV SXS MOTORCYCLE BIKE TRANSPORT HAUL MOVE CAR TRUCK MOVING TRAVELING STORAGE CARGO LOADS AUTHORITY BOAT HAULING BUSINESS BUSINESS FOR SALE JOB SALES CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT STEEL RAZOR SNOWMOBILE POLARIS YAHAMA WILD CAT MACHINE AUTOMOBILE AUTO VAN TOWING TOW VECHICLE SNOW RAIN BOX TRUCK FLATBED GOOSNECK BUMPER PULL HITCH BALL WEATHER BUY WOOD Westchester County, NY Amawalk, Annsville, Archville, Ardsley, Ardsley-on-Hudson, Armawalk, Armonk, Arthur Manor, Banksville, Bayberry Park, Bedford, Bedford Center, Bedford Hills, Beech Hill, Beechmont, Beechmont Woods, Bonnie Crest, Boutonville, Briarcliff Manor, Bronxville, Bronxville Heights, Bryn Mawr Park, Buchanan, Buckhout Corners, Butlerville, Cecil Park, Cedar Knolls, Chappaqua, Chauncey, Chester Hill Park, Chimney Corners, Colonial Acres, Colonial Heights, Crestwood, Crestwood Gardens, Crompond, Cross River, Croton Falls, Croton Heights, Croton-on-Hudson, Crotonville, Crugers, Dobbs Ferry, Dunwoodie, Dunwoodie Heights, East Irvington, East White Plains, East Woods, Eastchester, Eastview, Elmsford, Elmsmere, Fairview, Fleetwood, Forest Knolls, Fox Meadow, Furnace Woods, Gallows Hill, Glendale, Glenville, Glenwood, Goldens Bridge, Graham, Granite Springs, Grant Corner, Greenhaven, Greenville, Grey Oaks, Greystone, Gunther Park, Harrison, Hartsdale, Hastings-on-Hudson, Hawthorne, Heath Ridge, Heathcote, Heritage Hills, Homestead Park, Horseshoe Hill, Horton Estates, Huguenot Park, Irvington, Isle of San Souci, Jefferson Valley, Katonah, Kitchawan, Lake Katonah, Lake Lincolndale, Lake Mohegan, Lake Purdy, Larchmont, Lawrence Park, Lewisboro, Lincoln, Lincolndale, Lowerre, Ludlow, Mamaroneck, Maplewood, Mariandale, Millwood, Milton, Mohegan Heights, Mohegan Lake, Montrose, Mount Airy, Mount Hope, Mount Kisco, Mount Pleasant, Mount Vernon, Murdock Woods, Murray Hill, Nepera Park, Nepperhan, New Rochelle, North Salem, North White Plains, Oceola Lake, Orienta, Oscawana, Ossining, Park Hill, Parkside, Peekskill, Pelham, Pelham Manor, Philipse Manor, Pinebrook, Pinebrook Heights, Pleasantside, Pleasantville, Pocantico Hills, Port Chester, Pound Ridge, Purchase, Purdys, Purdys Grove, Quaker Ridge, Quarry Heights, Residence Park, Ridgeway, Rochelle Heights, Rochelle Park, Roe Park, Rosedale, Rye, Rye Brook, Salem Center, Sarles Corners, Scarborough, Scarsdale, Scarsdale Downs, Scarsdale Park, Scotts Corners, Secor Gardens, Shenorock, Sherman Park, Shore Acres, Shrub Oak, Sleepy Hollow, Sleepy Hollow Manor, Somers, South Salem, Sparta, Spring Valley, Stanwood, Sun Haven, Sunny Brae, Tarrytown, Thornwood, Toddville, Tompkins Corners, Tuckahoe, Twin Lakes Village, Valhalla, Valley Pond Estates, Van Cortlandtville, Vernon Park, Verplanck, Victory Park, Vista, Waccabuc, Waverly, West Mount Vernon, White Birches, White Plains, Whitehall Corners, Wilmot Woods, Windmill Farm, Woodlands, Woodybrook, Worthington, Wykagyl, Wykagyl Park, Yonkers, Yorktown, Yorktown Heights, brooklyn, queens, manhattan, nyc, bronx, staten island, long island, hudson valley",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,0.0,unknown,unknown,0.0,0.0,unknown,0.0,0,0,0,0,26

49,125000.0,saltlakecity,https://saltlakecity.craigslist.org/snw/d/salt-lake-city-class-10-race-car-kreger/7458371091.html,2022-03-23 10:05,Class 10 Race Car (Kreger Fabrication),24.0,"Kreger Fabrication Class 10 Race Car for Sale  What we have here is a race car that was so far ahead of its time in 2012 that even the best Class 10 race car fabricators are yet to matchup in 2022.  This incredible Class 10 race car has all the goodies on it. I purchased it as a used car in 2016, and even though it was Fabricated in 2012 the car sat in the original owners garage, was never raced once, and the only miles it had on it at the time was the original shake down after the 2012 fabrication. 2016 was the first time this car ever raced, and I raced it in the 2016 Baja 1000. We all know that a good race car is a good race car forever and age is often irrelevant, as long as it carries the latest and greatest racing technology, which it has, and I’ll list anything and everything you will want to know below… so please read the entire add, and look through all the pictured before you call about that car.  Everyone seems to know what a Kreger Car is, and everyone always says a Kreger Car is one of the best made race cars money can buy. As such, Kreger Cars are widely known to be one of the top class 1 and Class 10 brands in the desert. Whenever there are Kreger cars racing you constantly see them all in the top 5 of a race, if not in the top 3. This is impressive and says a lot about the car as there aren’t a ton of them out there, and there are even less that are actually racing. Last time we raced a full season was in 2018, and 2 Kreger Cars were in the top 3 for the Points that year… My Kreger and Peter Hajas Kreger car.   I own a couple Kreger Cars. I’m selling this car because I have purchased a Kreger Class 1 car that my team will be racing instead of class 10. I’d love to keep her sitting in the shop, but alas, its just too much to worry about and I need the money to dump into my new class program. Kreger cars are hands down the lightest Class 10 race car in the desert. None other can even come close to a Kreger when it comes to weight, which is incredibly important to a Class 10 race car. On top of being light they are tough as nails! Just get into the rough stuff and watch, you will catch everyone. Those of us who own Kreger cars always say “The Rougher the better”.  Kreger Fabrications designs are just incredible and so well thought out, and the quality of workmanship is apparent, you can see that those who built the car, mostly Derek Kreger himself, take great pride in every weld, but and bolt.  Once you have been racing a while you tend to not care as much about how sexy our race cars looks, or the lines they exhibit… Love it or hate it… the Kreger Car is the best looking Race Buggy in the desert. I remember I was in Baja Racing bikes and I came across John Walkers Class 1 race car down there. I couldn’t get it out of my head, so when I started looking to get into 4 wheel racing, the Kreger was the first car I thought about. The lines and look of the car were the original reason I even called Derek Kreger for the first time, I just really liked how Kreger Cars look. I have also driven many different brands, many of which are amazing cars… but the Kreger Car is the one I always settled on. In the pictures you will see a couple pictures with the panels on the car. These panels are incredible, and can be removed in 1 minute flat, by yourself. If your team is a proficient team, they can have the cars panels completely removed in less than 15 seconds, this includes the roof, hood, side panels, engine panels, and so on. Its just so well thought out its unbelievable.  Any chips or damage you see on the panels will be completely repaired by the time you see this ad. I’m having the panels stripped and sanded and resurfaced so they look like they are a high gloss white paint. So, they will be near perfect if you happen to come look the car over. BTW, the panels are so light, but some prefer not to have them, mostly to help loose a bit more weight, but honestly they are really light.  As for what equipment the car has, please go through the detailed list below for a comprehensive list of the cars equipment. There are likely a few items that could be updated to help make the car even faster.   1.	Fully Prepped- Kreger Race Support completed a full prep. There is only 100 miles on the prep, including Shake Down miles. I call it a Level 2 Race Prep. All CV’s replaced, Heim’s Replaced, Bushings replaced, Shocks rebuilt, HUB bearings replaced or repacked, Transmission fully prepped, Engine taken out and all fluids replaced, Clutch Replaced, Wheels aligned, and fully washed down. I know there is way more to it than that, but the car drives like new every time Kreger Preps the car, as it should.  2.	Kreger Tube Frame- Class 10 Race car frame (Score tagged, and BITD Legal and ready to race) 3.	Kreger Arms- Kreger Class 10 Trailing ARMs and A-Arms. These arms arnt brand new, but are in good condition and have A LOT of life left in them. 4.	Kreger HUBS - Kreger HUBs are incredible and are the only hubs that allow the Axle to be replaced without taking the wheel off.  5.	Kreger Design-  The incredible design of the Kreger Hubs, boots, and Arms allow this car to have a Whopping 24 inches of Travel on all 4 corners of the car. Very few class 10 cars to this day have a full 24 inches of travel up front and in the rear.  6.	King Shocks- 3.0 Triple Bypass on all 4 corners.  a.	I have seen so many cars over the years pulled over due to their shocks overheating. We are a top class 10 team and haven’t ever had this issue. I’m not sure why, or if its due to my driving style, or the car doing a better job at cooling the reservoirs.  b.	One item I do think would make this car faster is bigger 3.5 Shocks in the front and rear. There is a tradeoff in weight… but I would personally like to try it. The problem for me is I have never had an issue with the handling of the car, as its tuned great for me, and we do make small adjustment depending on the race, but its hard to spend 25 grand on new 3.5 shocks to see if they are better or not. I believe the only difference you may ever see is the very bottom end of hard hits to the shocks, which don’t happen all the time anyways.   7.	King Shocks- 3.0 Spring custom built for a Kreger Car.  8.	Engine- The engine is the latest and greatest in Class 10.  a.	Wiks Direct Injection Ecotec tuned and tagged by Wiks himself. I have 600 documentable race miles on this engine. I can prove it if needed. This engine is just getting broken in at 600 miles.  b.	I know Ecotec engines stay pretty cool anyways, but there are some races that are really hard on even an Ecotec, I have seen plenty other class 10 cars pulled over due to overheating. This car will NEVER overheat. The radiator is directly in the path of air on this car, and it’s a deep radiator, and Kreger also fabricated a system that can handle 2 liters of extra coolant that the engine can call on if needed.  9.	Transmission- Fortin Sequential 6 speed (No lift Shift) Transmission with 100 documentable miles on the rebuild of the tranny. (Maintained by Daniel Folts).  This Tranny is widely known as the best transmission a Class 10 race car can have. I have NEVER has 1 issue with this tranny. Its bullet Proof and Amazing. 10.	CV’s & Axles- 934 CV’s… The big ones. Never break an axle, ever!  The CV’s are also the highest quality steel CV’s money can buy.  11.	ECU- Motec Engine Computer that is fully programmable. I had the life computer, but it was junk compared to this computer, but Motec comes at a cost. 12.	Dash Display- Motec Dash display that has all the goodies and is completely programmed with all buttons and panels on the dash. The Motec Control unit controls all lighting, fuel pumps, etc… at the touch of a button. The motec display also has everything on display and allows you to scroll through all engine info such as LAMBDA, RPM, etc.  It can be programmed to tell you when to shift, and can also monitor tire PSI, and will also let you know when something is out of wack.  13.	Fuel- The Motec is programmed to use Sonoco E-85 race fuel, and I’m pretty sure it can also sense when non-E-85 fuel is being used and the Motec ECU will automatically switch programs… I have to double check on this, but we never have anything in the car except E85, so I honestly cant remember.  Could probably gain some speed by using a higher E rated fuel.. like E96 if one wanted.  14.	Fuel Tank- 35 Gallon Race Legal fuel tank. Replaced approx. 2 years ago. We replaced it to get a few more gallons in the car.  15.	Speed Limiter- Speed Limited adjustable Switch and knob (never get hit for speeding in the pits again). 3 Settings… 25 MPH, 28 MPH, and 60 MPH.  16.	Fuel System- 2 High grade fuel pumps… Pump A is the main Pump, and pump B is the backup pump. The fuel pumps are independently controlled by the Motec Dash.  All Fuel Lines are Steel Braided Teflon lined hoses, all professionally cut and mounted to terminate with special race grade, and good looking, Aluminum fittings. Making it sooo easy to swap parts in and out. The Teflon hosing lasts much longer than the normal tubing as E-85 fuel is tough on rubber and plastics.  a.	Another way I believe some speed can be gained is by tuning the engine to use E-96 race fuel. It won’t add much, but it will give an edge with a light car like this, especially on shorter style race courses.  17.	Wheels & Tires- Tire Pressure Monitoring System. Huge advantage when racing. Honestly, we haven’t really needed to use it with the new BFG kR3 tires we have been using.  a.	Car to come with 10 Brand New 35-inch BFG KR3 Tires will come with the car.  b.	I will also send a bunch of used tires that are still very much good which we use as spares and front tires very often. c.	OMF Wheels- I had OMF Custom Make 10 Forged and Machined Aluminum Wheels. Believe it or not we saved 4 to 5 pounds of rotating mass, on each corner, when compared to Method wheels, we had been running before. These Wheels are 5.5 inches wide and I can’t recall the offset.  d.	The OMF wheels are also modular, which means if one side bends or breaks you can replace it. They have been incredible for us on this car and we instantly noticed the car was faster with them. e.	I’m very loyal to BFG… however, I do believe the tensor tires would add some speed and HP to the ground over the BFG tires… but again, there is always a tradeoff. The Tensor tires are amazing, and fast, but they go flat far more often than the BFG KR3 tires. I had a seasons were we didn’t even get a flat tire during the race, and that’s incredible. It shows how good BFG is at what they do, and these KR3 tires also handle incredible.  18.	Steering-  We use a Howe Steering Rack which was also replaced last year, but only because I had another car that needed a new steering rack, so I gave it to this car and took the old one off to put it on the other car. I only put the best on this car. a.	MOMO Suede Steering Wheel. b.	Extra Steering Pump stowed behind the driver’s right side of the seat and it will remain with the car.  c.	Tie Rods are 1-inch Chromoly steel, and are also powder coated to match the Arms. I have never bent a tie rod on this car as they are incredibly strong.  i.	I have a spare Tie Rod, and used to carry it on the car until I found they never have issues.  d.	I have literally never had a steering issue on this car. It can pound through the roughest terrain you can think of and you will be driving with 1 finger if you want.  e.	Extra Large Power Steering Fluid Reservoir.   19.	Electrical System-  The wiring/electrical of Kreger cars is one of the items that has always separated them from the rest.  a.	Kreger has a wiring harness built for all its race cars. This harness fits the car perfect. All wires to the engine, in the dash, to the batteries, and so on are all the perfect measurement and spliced and shrunk wrapped to look down right pretty.  b.	Cannon Cable Plugs are placed at all Major Terminations of the wiring, like at the engine, dash, lights, and so on. To remove the Dash you simply twist the cannon plug and unplug it, and then pull the dash off! The same goes for the Engine, Light bar, and coms system. Its perfect.  c.	 Extra 1 wire Alternator stowed under the hood of the car will also come with the car.  20.	Communications- Once again, this car has pretty much the best (Except for a satellite radio system) that money can buy.  a.	110 Watt Kenwood in the dash radio. This thing is incredible, it can handle most race courses.  b.	PCI Trax Intercom for the Driver & Copilot. This system has a driver isolate button as well as an incredible sound filter that helps block out anything but voice. Last of all it is Bluetooth compatible, so you can pump in some tunes during the race.  c.	No Ground Plane antenna.. This is only 12 inches tall, and its incredible. Custom cut for this race car so it gets perfect reception.  21.	On Board Storage- Hostile Bags are the primary way you can store parts, tools, food, water and First Aid items.  Not pictured… but I will send all the custom made Hostile Bags.  They are specifically made to fit in between the tubes of the cars frame. The tool bag sits below the co-pilots feet.  a.	The Car has a nifty way of stowing an emergency breaker bar.  On the right of the co-pilot, and its not pictured. 22.	Safety – This car is race ready, and should pass any Tech Inspection. It has the following safety items.  a.	New Parker Pumper- We just had our pumper give up the ghost, so we just replaced it and its filer.  b.	Impact 5 Point seat belt Harness.  c.	Sun Visor. d.	Mastercraft window netting. e.	Mastercraft Suspension seats.   f.	Lowrance GPS- Touch and Split Screen. g.	First Aid Kit. h.	Race Rated Kevlar Fuel Cell. i.	Anti-Spill Ball Valve on fuel tank if you find yourself upside down.  j.	1 of all major spare parts. k.	Stop Lights, Running Lights and Rear Amber Flashing Light Bar. l.	Triangles for being stopped.  m.	I finally took the time to find a horn that people can hear… well, its works better, but not perfect. 23.	Lighting-  This car has the ability to control all lighting separate via the motec dash control unit. Just the touch of a button, and the best part is the Motec Dash control unit is completely programmable.  a.	Baja Designs LP 9 Amber Front Lights.  Since I have had these I haven’t had much need for the light bar, unless it’s a true night race.  b.	Baja Designs built in hood lights. These are programmed to flash back and forth to better help your crew identify when you are coming in to pit… or if you are down for mechanical repairs. c.	Baja Designs quick mount light bar.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,0.0,unknown,unknown,0.0,0.0,unknown,0.0,0,0,0,0,29

Did it succeed? Or was it just trying to please all the people all the time? Around 1980, the full-size motorcycle market began splintering into numerous niches, including the Factory Custom. Seats grew steps, bars pulled back, footpegs inched forward, and clean drive shafts replaced messy chains. No doubt mindful that its game-changing V4s were in the pipeline, Honda stretched its trusty 4-valve inline 750cc to 900cc, then laid back its ergonomics to take on Suzuki’s cruiser GS850/1100GL and Yamaha’s similarly-themed XS1100 Special. Essentially, Honda hijacked the engine from its Euro-spec CB900F to power the CB900C. The air-cooled, 16-valve double overhead cam with pent-roof combustion chambers was fed by four 32mm Keihin carburetors. A single-piece forged crankshaft drove a jackshaft via a Hy-Vo chain, with gear drive from the jackshaft to the clutch and 5-speed tranny. Shaft drive was de rigueur in the custom class, so to keep development costs down Honda borrowed the final drive unit from the GL1100 to use on the 900C. There was, however, one minor problem using the GL unit: the CB900’s tranny output was on the bike’s left side, and the GL1100’s shaft was on the right. Honda’s solution was a crossover shaft — actually, two shafts incorporating two pairs of gears. This gave the CB900C a 2-speed “Select Range” secondary transmission sitting in its own transfer case, complete with its own trochoidal oil pump for lubrication. And while it wasn’t as complicated as it sounds, it wasn’t exactly simple. Cycle magazine counted “20 gears, six shafts, a dozen bearings, three torque cushions, a U-joint and assorted couplings employed in making the crank/rear wheel connection.” The 2-speed transfer case meant 10 forward gears, giving CB900C riders incredible flexibility in gearing. It also went a long way toward the bike’s reasonable fuel economy. Kept in “high” range, reports of 50mpg were common. That said, left in “low” range and ridden with a heavy right hand the CB900C would return as little as 30mpg. Yet the multitude of driveline components allowed generous driveline lash, which, combined with lean EPA-mandated carburetion, made for herky-jerky throttle transitions “the like of which you won’t find in any other motorcycle presently in production,” Cycle said. The extra transmission case also stretched the frame, and thus lengthened the wheelbase to a Harley-esque 62 inches — even using a short swingarm. This latter item introduced its own problems, causing noticeable torque jacking under acceleration and a lack of rear end traction under braking, chirping the rear tire. And the C-bike weighed in at nearly 590 pounds ready to ride, making it just about the heaviest machine in its class. In most other respects, though, the 900C worked really well. Testers praised its electric-motor-like power delivery; lack of vibration (the engine was rubber-mounted); straight-line performance (less than 12.5 seconds at almost 110mph in the quarter mile — on  par with the XS11 and GS11); adjustable air-assisted suspension (also derived from the GL1100); and even its handling — in spite of a lazy 29-degree steering angle and squirmy 16-inch rear tire. Comfort was good (though the stepped seat trapped the rider in one position), brakes powerful and resistant to fade, and the 2-speed tranny reduced engine speed by a useful 500rpm at highway cruising speeds — and fuel consumption by as much as 16 percent if left in high. Even so, Cycle Guide concluded the extra five gears “bordered on the redundant” and a similar result “could easily have been accomplished with a 6-speed transmission.” Built to Honda’s typically high standards, CB900Cs could pile on the miles. The 2-speed transfer case doesn’t appear to have any negative impact on reliability, and like other Honda fours the 900C had few major problem areas. But what really baffled testers was how to classify the CB900C. Was it a cruiser, a tourer or a new type of sport bike? Though intended to appeal to American buyers, the custom styling left Cycle Guide testers cold. One called it the “King Kong Kompromise Kruiser,” while another considered it a dinosaur and hoped its inevitable extinction would “mark a return to a more sensible line of motorcycles where sheer size is not a prime factor.” A third thought it had been “dressed by committee.” Ultimately, it was a bike in search of a market, and while briefly popular, it was dropped after just three years in Honda’s lineup. It’s perhaps ironic to note that the CB900C, a decidedly large bike when introduced, looks like a featherweight alongside today’s gargantuan boulevard bikes. Maybe it was just 30 years ahead of its time.WE BUY CARS AND CONSIGN CARSMORE PICTURES and VIDEO CLIPS ON OUR WEBSITE: www.DesertPrivateCollection.comWE BUY CLASSIC CARS - CONSIGN and SELL - PHOTO SHOOT RENTAL IS AVAILABLECalifornia buyers must pay CA sales tax , all prices in USD .  Disclaimer-Finance Requirements listed at our website-Price does not include sales tax and DMV registration feesMonthly payment is based on approved Credit for more Inventory VISIT OUR WEBSITE https://www.desertprivatecollection.com/ or call (760) 313-6607FOR CONSIGNMENT PLEASE CONTACT US (760) 313-6607This head turning 1980 Honda CR 900 Standard fits your budget at $2,750.

At the front wheel, a radially-mounted, four-piston, fixed brake caliper bites onto a floating 320 mm disc. Thanks to a forgiving setup of the two-channel ABS, the huge potential of these brakes can always be fully utilized. CHASSIS - CHASSIS: The 9 kg tubular trellis frame made from chrome-molybdenum steel and the equally lightweight, smoking hot swingarm, die-cast in aluminum, impress with extreme levels of torsional stiffness, providing the 148.5 kg Duke with excellent tracking stability and a continuous flow of information to the rider. Triple clamps lower the fork offset, which underlines this characteristic even further. You’ll notice.  ENGINE & EXHAUST - ENGINE: From the trademark 690 cm³ thumper, the engineers have extracted a whopping 73 hp (54 kW) and 74 Nm of torque, making light work of the equally lightweight 690 Duke. How it happened? They completely reworked the cylinder head, inserted an ultra light and extremely strong piston and connection rod, rerouted the air intake through a resonator chamber and provided the crankshaft with sleeve bearings. As a result, the powerband is a thousand rpm wider, which means an even more uniform power delivery, especially in the mid to high rev range. Twin ignition featuring plug-selective mapping, rock solid but featherweight internals and optimized intake and exhaust systems cultivate this massive mono to be as strong as it is smooth, assisted by an advanced ride-by-wire system, which guarantees great refinement as well as low fuel consumption and emission figures. You’re green, while they’re green with envy. And you haven’t even begun mentioning upmarket goodies like a standard slipper clutch.  ENGINE MANAGEMENT: The electronic engine management system lives to make the LC4 shine. Twin ignition with individual mappings for each spark plug ensures that your precious fuel is always burned to perfection, irrespective of load and engine speed. And then there is genuine ride-by-wire, in other words: Electronically controlled throttle valve actuation without any mechanical linkage. You’d be forgiven for thinking it runs on cream. Whipped cream, that is. EXHAUST: Thanks to its optimized intake and exhaust system, the LC4 engine even complies with the Euro IV emission control standards. A first in KTM’s history. MASS CENTRALIZATION: The Duke does not only impress with its low weight and perfect chassis geometry; the centralization of weight - for example, by positioning the brushed stainless steel pre-silencer under the engine - also contributes to its playful handling and razor-sharp precision. ERGONOMICS & COMFORT - ERGONOMICS & COMFORT: Despite its pronounced lust for cornering, the 690 Duke also presents versatile real-world capabilities. On a daily basis, particularly the two-piece seat will prove a valuable friend. It’s comfortable and spacious, while still being set up for all dynamic riding situations. The seating position and freedom of movement behind the wide aluminum handlebar provide perfect support for controlling the bike both in traffic hell as well as cornering heaven. Workday commute or weekend blast: the 690 Duke has your back.  SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICS - ABS: The dual-circuit ABS system with 9M+ modulator, fine-tuned in cooperation with Bosch, offers total protection against over-braking, while maintaining the full effect and glorious feedback of a genuine sports brake thanks to hypersensitive sensors. This ABS system, weighing no more than one kilogram, therefore allows extremely sporty braking, while actively preventing loop-outs. And just so you know: It’s disengageable. So stoppies are still allowed.  WHEELS & SUSPENSION - SUSPENSION: The upside-down fork on the Duke (with a 43 mm diameter) and pivot-arm articulated pressurized-gas monoshock, both by WP, excel with flawless tuning and a broad spectrum of use for all demands, from relaxed cruising to hammering around on closed circuits. The options are limitless, and so is your lean angle.

Built them ourselves from the OC kit. I've done all the hard work, now you can just ride!  Great for when you don't want/can't get to the skate park.  With the pair can set them side by side for wider 6ft wide quarter-pipe, or facing for more of a half-pipe, or even back-to-back to go up over and down other side.  Always stored in garage, never exposed to weather. normal wear, fully funtional and very sturdy.  We bought the Skate Paint but never applied, costs over $100 for the gallon that is enough to treat both ramps. I'll throw that in for free.  These go for $780 new for the pair + $110 gallon of Skate Paint, plus they're already built for you that's $900 value only asking $500.",unknown,unknown,unknown,good,0.0,unknown,unknown,1.0,0.0,unknown,1.0,1,0,0,0,32

Listing details:  * QUICK RELEASE: The handle at the stationary bike trainer not only can release the bike off the trainer quickly by lifting up, but also can lock the bike to the trainer quickly by pressing down. Very simple and convenient, the indoor bike trainer is easy for everyone to handle. * 6 SPEED RESISTANCE: With a remote controller of 6-level speed by a wire, you can change resistance to comply with the cycling conditions you want and enjoy different riding experiences. After quick installation, you can begin to ride. 1-2 speed offer less resistance when comparing with the 5 or 6 spped. * STEADY, STABLE AND FIRM: The indoor exercise bike trainer is designed with dual-support structure. The wide frame and front wheel riser block included in the package keep it away from wobbling and reach unshakable balance. The steady base and adjustable anti-slip rubber feet fits for uneven floor in different conditions, preventing movement for stability on any surface. * SMOOTH IN SPIN: When riding a bike at home, a smooth bike exercise trainer is definitely necessary. Bike trainer with noise reduction resistance wheel makes your cycling virtually silent. BTW, if noise is loud, it has a lot to do with the materials and tread of bike tires, we sincerely suggest you to use a slick tire. * COMPATIBLE WITH BIKES: The Unisky indoor riding bicycle training stand fits bikes with a 26-28"" or 700c wheel, most road or mountain bikes . There is no need to buy a new one if you have a road or mountain bike of normal size. Bring your bike inside and begin indoor cycling workout. After exercise, take the bike off the trainer, fold the bike trainer and put it at any corner.

The same pin can also be used to tilt the rack down 20 degrees for easier bike loading. The tilting feature can also be used when the is rack fully loaded, so you can gain easier access to your vehicle's rear cargo area without unloading your bikes.  Removable 2-Bike Add-On The rack includes a 2-bike add-on that installs easily onto the base rack. When it's not needed, simply remove the add-on with the included special tool and throw it in your trunk or leave it at home. To install the add-on on your HoldUp, simply remove the endcap from the bike rack base, slide the add-on's shank into the hole on the bike rack, and secure the shank with a bolt that comes with the add-on. The add-on includes a safty flag post to ensure that the rack is visible to other vehicles on the road.   Wheel-Mount Design for Easy Bike Loading The HoldUp is easy to load, even if your bikes have monster wheels. The deep, contoured front wheel cradles accommodate just about any wheel out there, and the pivoting arms with StrongArm technology ensure that your bikes are held firmly in place. To load a bike, simply place your front wheel in the holder, rotate the pivoting arm up and over the wheel, and press down firmly on the ratcheting hook. To release the hook, simply press the built-in red button and slide the hook up and off your wheel. Large rear wheel holders allow the HoldUp to accommodate a wide variety of bike wheelbases. These wheel holders pivot front to back, adjusting automatically to your wheel size - no need for sliding and tightening. Secure the wheels in place with the ratcheting straps built into each holder. Mounting bikes by the wheels helps prevent any scratches or scuffs to the paint. The ratcheting hooks are padded, however, so they won't mar your wheels. And the pivot mechanisms in the arms are overbuilt to ensure they keep functioning smoothly over a lifetime of hard use.",unknown,unknown,unknown,excellent,0.0,unknown,unknown,0.0,0.0,unknown,0.0,0,0,0,0,3

Full carbon frameset.  Full Ultegra groupset.  This model has Trek's ISOSpeed feature... for an even smoother ride than carbon fiber frames already give.  https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/inside_trek/isospeed/  Frame sticker says this is a 56cm.  But also says the top tube is more of a 55cm.  Complete specs here:  https://archive.trekbikes.com/ca/en/2014/Trek/domane_4_7_wsd_compact  Technically this is a WSD / women's model... but road bike frames are unisex so only the ""touch points"" are different (handlebar and saddle) on the female versions... and the paint colors / graphics.  And this particular color scheme is not particularly girly.  (White and charcoal w/ a couple of dark fuscia TREK logos.)  In terms of sizing, if you ride a 56cm bike, you ride a 56cm bike... there is no ""womens 56cm"" or ""mens 56cm"".  56cm is 56cm.   Bike has normal wear from typical recreational riding... but overall is in fantastic condition.  Height-wise, for a 55/56cm frame you should be in the 5'8 to 5'11 range... but could certainly work for someone a little smaller or a little taller with some fitting.  I will include the after-market accessories... water bottle cages, tail bag (behind the saddle), and frame bag (behind stem)... and the CatEye trip computer.    The bike was just at Fletcher Bike Studio in Montrose getting new bar tape and a light tune up / adjustment... just to make sure it is perfect for the next owner.  (Great bike shop by the way!)  The Domane is Trek's ""endurance"" road platform... which means less aggressive / more comfortable right out of the box than their racier bikes (like the Madone and the Emonda).  You could certainly tweak this bike to get it more racey if that's what you're looking for.  But most people are looking for a good combination of speed and comfort.  And that's what the Domane is all about.  Love the bike but I upgraded to a newer model.  54cm 55cm 57cm specialzed roubaix giant propel tcr defy 54 55 56 cm",carbon fiber,road,special,excellent,0.0,unknown,unknown,0.0,0.0,unknown,0.0,0,0,0,0,4

Looks tight.  58cm full OCLV carbon fiber frameset. (Ideal for riders in the 5'-10"" to 6'-2"" range... with the sweet spot being somewhere in the middle.)   Full Shimano Ultegra groupset.   (3x10 w/ a (rare) long cage rear derailleur for larger cassette capacity) = 30 speeds.  Excellent for weekend hill country riding, MS-150, the Rockies on vacation, etc.  The bike is in very good condition, with normal wear from typical riding. Never crashed. Always stored indoors and professionally maintained.   Just had Fletcher Bike Studio install a brand new ($65 Ultegra 12/23) cassette and brand new ($35 KMC) chain + new cables and housings, then re-adjust shifting to perfection.  Also had them re-wrap the bars with new bar tape.  (Total = $150)  So, short of a major component or wheel failure--which is rare--the bike should be good for thousands of miles without needing any major service.  This bike is very light for a road bike (around 17 to 17.5 lbs).  The 5.2 Madones are very highly rated / reviewed by their owners.  https://www.roadbikereview.com/product/latest-bikes/road-bike/trek/madone-5-2.html?p=8  This particular bike is more or less factory original... with the exception of upgraded wheels and tires (red anodized Mavic Heliums with red Continental Grand Prix 4000's) and the water bottle cages... and the above mentioned major service that was just done.  (Zero miles since service.)  Bike is 100% ready for the road today.  Needs nothing at all.  Just clip in and go.

The clutch and brake levers are a little bent but can be easily replaced. I bought these to ride but I decided a quad would be more useful around the house. These are great bikes. They are pretty fast and fun. 2600 for the pair. Local delivery may be available if close. I would consider a trade for a quad 350cc and up 4x4 in good condition.

The chassis is an active part of the handling equation, backed up with premium Showa suspension at both ends. But what the spec charts can’t show is the level of refinement that only Honda brings to the class, all with the goal of letting you rail through the corners, flatten out the whoops, ace the rhythm sections and do it lap after lap with incredible precision.Looking for the best of the best? Then check out our CRF450RWE (WE for Works Edition). We’ve fine-tuned it with special touches like an exclusive Yoshimura exhaust, Twin Air filter, Throttle Jockey seat cover, Hinson clutch basket and cover, premium DID DirtStar LT-X rims, Kashima and titanium nitrate-coated forks, a red cylinder head cover, and hands-on touches like special cylinder-head porting. Both the RWE and the CRF450R get suspension and engine setting changes for 2022, sharpening the best bike on the track even a little more. Ready to win? Because we’re ready to ride.Features may include:HANDLINGLIGHT NARROW FRAMEGreat handling starts with a superior frame, and that’s one place where the CRF450R’s chassis puts you out front. First, it’s light—over a pound and a half lighter than the previous generation’s. By making the frame’s main spars narrow, we save weight, but more important we make the chassis more responsive by fine-tuning the lateral rigidity. The result is a bike that gets into, around, and out of corners faster.ENGINEERINGHYDRAULIC CLUTCHThe CRF450R features the first hydraulically actuated clutch we’ve offered outside of our works bikes. Made by Nissin, it’s the same design as in our Grand Prix MX machines, and performs better than third-party conversions. You get a clutch-lever pull that’s ten percent lighter at its peak, even though it’s paired with a new, stronger 8-plate clutch. Plus, you’ll never have to worry about making a clutch-cable adjustment, even during the longest events.CONVENIENCESEALED AIRBOX AND FILTERAlong with the special air filter, the airbox shape helps deliver more torque. You can access the airbox through the left number plate. And because the CRF450R’s filter has no rubber gasket where it interfaces with the intake boot, cleaning and servicing the filter is faster and less messy than ever.PERFORMANCEEXCLUSIVE WORKS EDITIONSimply stated, the best of the best. The CRF450RWE Works Edition includes all the standard CRF450R features, but also gets a special hand-ported cylinder head; Hinson clutch basket and cover; Twin Air filter, Throttle Jockey graphics and seat cover; upgraded DID DirtStar LT-X rims; an exclusive Yoshimura exhaust system including a titanium header; titanium nitride-coated lower fork legs; revalved suspension; an RK gold chain; special ECU settings; and black triple clamps.

Here is a glimpse at just the top ten uses of utility trailers:  1.Automobiles: From time to time it becomes necessary to haul an inoperable car or truck. Tow trucks are expensive, especially if the distance is great. A utility trailer is a great way to haul vehicles and a good investment if you need to do so regularly.  2.Boats: If you have a boat, you will need a utility trailer to get it to and from the water.  3.Lawn Care Equipment: If you live in a rural area, you may find that you need to haul your mowing equipment from one piece of your property to another. Packing equipment and loading it into a pickup truck bed can get old very quickly. A utility trailer will allow you to drive your equipment right up onto the trailer without the aid of ramps or two strong men.  4.Furniture: Moving furniture is a breeze with a utility trailer. Furniture dollies roll right up onto the trailer and you can haul more than you can with a pickup.  5.Building Supplies: Do you have projects that need to be done around the house? Pick up your own building supplies and save on delivery fees.  6.Bikes, Motorcycles, and ATVs: Recreational vehicles are best hauled on a utility trailer.  7.Livestock: An enclosed utility trailer is most often used to haul livestock.  8.Auction and Flea Markets: If you frequent auctions and flea markets, you will need the hauling capability to bring home your inexpensive and rare finds.  9.Appliances: Utility trailers are ideal for hauling appliances.  10.Debris and Trash: Loading trash in and out of your pickup bed can be cumbersome and clean up can be messy, but it would be worse to have to haul trash in your SUV. Clean up after a big job is a lot easier with a utility trailer.  As you can see, there are many reasons why an investment in a utility trailer is a smart move. I'm sure that with a little time, and its easy availability, you will come up with even more ways to use a trailer  ATV UTV SXS MOTORCYCLE BIKE TRANSPORT HAUL MOVE CAR TRUCK MOVING TRAVELING STORAGE CARGO LOADS AUTHORITY BOAT HAULING BUSINESS BUSINESS FOR SALE JOB SALES CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT STEEL RAZOR SNOWMOBILE POLARIS YAHAMA WILD CAT MACHINE AUTOMOBILE AUTO VAN TOWING TOW VECHICLE SNOW RAIN BOX TRUCK FLATBED GOOSNECK BUMPER PULL HITCH BALL WEATHER BUY WOOD Westchester County, NY Amawalk, Annsville, Archville, Ardsley, Ardsley-on-Hudson, Armawalk, Armonk, Arthur Manor, Banksville, Bayberry Park, Bedford, Bedford Center, Bedford Hills, Beech Hill, Beechmont, Beechmont Woods, Bonnie Crest, Boutonville, Briarcliff Manor, Bronxville, Bronxville Heights, Bryn Mawr Park, Buchanan, Buckhout Corners, Butlerville, Cecil Park, Cedar Knolls, Chappaqua, Chauncey, Chester Hill Park, Chimney Corners, Colonial Acres, Colonial Heights, Crestwood, Crestwood Gardens, Crompond, Cross River, Croton Falls, Croton Heights, Croton-on-Hudson, Crotonville, Crugers, Dobbs Ferry, Dunwoodie, Dunwoodie Heights, East Irvington, East White Plains, East Woods, Eastchester, Eastview, Elmsford, Elmsmere, Fairview, Fleetwood, Forest Knolls, Fox Meadow, Furnace Woods, Gallows Hill, Glendale, Glenville, Glenwood, Goldens Bridge, Graham, Granite Springs, Grant Corner, Greenhaven, Greenville, Grey Oaks, Greystone, Gunther Park, Harrison, Hartsdale, Hastings-on-Hudson, Hawthorne, Heath Ridge, Heathcote, Heritage Hills, Homestead Park, Horseshoe Hill, Horton Estates, Huguenot Park, Irvington, Isle of San Souci, Jefferson Valley, Katonah, Kitchawan, Lake Katonah, Lake Lincolndale, Lake Mohegan, Lake Purdy, Larchmont, Lawrence Park, Lewisboro, Lincoln, Lincolndale, Lowerre, Ludlow, Mamaroneck, Maplewood, Mariandale, Millwood, Milton, Mohegan Heights, Mohegan Lake, Montrose, Mount Airy, Mount Hope, Mount Kisco, Mount Pleasant, Mount Vernon, Murdock Woods, Murray Hill, Nepera Park, Nepperhan, New Rochelle, North Salem, North White Plains, Oceola Lake, Orienta, Oscawana, Ossining, Park Hill, Parkside, Peekskill, Pelham, Pelham Manor, Philipse Manor, Pinebrook, Pinebrook Heights, Pleasantside, Pleasantville, Pocantico Hills, Port Chester, Pound Ridge, Purchase, Purdys, Purdys Grove, Quaker Ridge, Quarry Heights, Residence Park, Ridgeway, Rochelle Heights, Rochelle Park, Roe Park, Rosedale, Rye, Rye Brook, Salem Center, Sarles Corners, Scarborough, Scarsdale, Scarsdale Downs, Scarsdale Park, Scotts Corners, Secor Gardens, Shenorock, Sherman Park, Shore Acres, Shrub Oak, Sleepy Hollow, Sleepy Hollow Manor, Somers, South Salem, Sparta, Spring Valley, Stanwood, Sun Haven, Sunny Brae, Tarrytown, Thornwood, Toddville, Tompkins Corners, Tuckahoe, Twin Lakes Village, Valhalla, Valley Pond Estates, Van Cortlandtville, Vernon Park, Verplanck, Victory Park, Vista, Waccabuc, Waverly, West Mount Vernon, White Birches, White Plains, Whitehall Corners, Wilmot Woods, Windmill Farm, Woodlands, Woodybrook, Worthington, Wykagyl, Wykagyl Park, Yonkers, Yorktown, Yorktown Heights, brooklyn, queens, manhattan, nyc, bronx, staten island, long island, hudson valley",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,0.0,unknown,unknown,0.0,0.0,unknown,0.0,0,0,0,0,12

Which is why we’re offering two models of our new Honda Talon—probably the most anticipated side-by-sides ever. Both share the same powerful, Talon-specific high-output engine, quick-shifting Automatic DCT Transmission, exclusive I-4WD technology package and all-new chassis. Rider comfort? Nobody does it like Honda. Performance? We’ve built our reputation on it. The key differences between the two: The Talon 1000R has a longer wheelbase, a wider vehicle track, and more suspension travel. It’s a perfect match for riders who tackle rugged, high-speed terrain. The Talon 1000R is proof positive that life is better, side by side.Features may include:ENGINEPOWERFUL 999cc TWIN-CYLINDER ENGINESport side-by-sides need power, and you’re sure to find the new Talon 1000R offers plenty of it. The Talon 1000R’s 999cc liquid-cooled inline twin delivers the kind of powerful torque and quick-revving horsepower you’d expect from a flagship sport model, but is equally responsive in lower revs and in the critical midrange too. Set longitudinally in the chassis and managed by Honda’s sophisticated PGM-FI engine-mapping system, it delivers the kind of refinement no other side-by-side can match.UNICAM CYLINDER HEAD DESIGNThe Talon 1000R’s 999cc liquid-cooled inline twin uses the same proven Unicam® cylinder head design found in our championship-winning motocross bikes. That helps make the engine more compact, which lets us position it for optimal weight distribution and ground clearance.CHASSISCHASSIS AND SUSPENSIONThe Talon 1000R’s refined, high-performance chassis forms the basis for its superior handling and stability. From there we add long-travel independent front and rear suspension and generous ground clearance. Plus, the Talon 1000R gets premium, FOX Podium 2.5 shocks with QS-3 quick adjustors on all four corners.DRIVETRAINAUTOMATIC SIX-SPEED DCT TRANSMISSIONThe convenience of an automatic with the strength, control, and efficiency of a manual, Honda’s DCT lets you drive the way you want. Choose between manual mode or fully automatic. Plus, the addition of Sport Mode increases the fun, shifting at higher RPMs for a spirited, full-performance driving experience. DCT puts you in control as to what engine speed you want, and what gear ratio. Or you can let it do all the thinking for you. In addition, you also get genuine compression braking and a more efficient power delivery than a belt-driven CVT.Sunrise Pre-Owned Motorsports3201 East Park PlazaSearcy, AR 72143Ask for: Pre-Owned Sales5013052900: (501) 305-2900A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 34240346 10380728",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,0.0,unknown,unknown,0.0,0.0,unknown,0.0,0,0,0,0,16

Using the same Unicam® cylinder head design found in our motocross bikes, it’s more compact in size, and it still delivers the kind of horsepower and torque you’d expect from a flagship model.HANDLINGCHASSIS AND SUSPENSIONPrepare to go further than ever before. Our refined chassis enables you to tackle terrain others would shy away from, with larger tires, long-travel independent front and rear suspension and huge ground clearance. The rubber mounted engine and exhaust system insulates against excessive vibration and the self-leveling rear suspension compensation for changing loads. Plus, the Pioneer 1000-5 Limited Edition gets premium, quick-adjust FOX QS-3 shocks on all four corners.VERSATILITYQUICKFLIP® SEATINGWant to bring an extra one or two passengers along for the ride? Two QuickFlip® seats pop up from the cargo bed on Pioneer 1000-5 models, giving you the extra seating you need, when you need it. Exclusive to Honda, it’s a smarter system than fixed seat, multi-row models, giving you better maneuverability on the trails.COMFORT3-PERSON CONTOURED BENCH SEATTough, durable and built to enhance every driving experience — yes, we’re talking about the seat. Contoured for three passengers, the center seat is positioned up and forward to maximize space and comfort, and the covering is designed to resist both the elements and heavy use.LCD DISPLAYThe multi-function LCD dash display is large enough to host loads of information, in an easy-to-read way, like speed and fuel level. RPM and transmission mode. Fuel gauge, water temperature, trip information and more. It even includes a clock, so you’ll always know when it’s time for some fun.SAFETYDRIVER/PASSENGER PROTECTIONThe Occupant Protection Structure uses large-diameter tubing, and meets OSHA’s rollover protection standard. The hard doors and roll-up side nets help keep debris from entering the cabin, and auto-style three-point seatbelts are equipped with an emergency locking retractor mechanism, to help optimize passenger security. When you put this much safety first, fun is sure to follow.Sunrise Pre-Owned Motorsports3201 East Park PlazaSearcy, AR 72143Ask for: Pre-Owned Sales5013052900: (501) 305-2900A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 34240350 10380697",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,0.0,unknown,unknown,0.0,0.0,unknown,0.0,0,0,0,0,16

Riding weather is back so one last time...  This is a 2000 Vianelli Corsa in excellent condition and ready to ride. It used to be my go-to but I no longer ride like I did.  Tires, cables and housings, chain, brake pads, bar tape were replaced recently. Bike has been refurbished and tuned, all bearings replaced, cleaned and lubricated. Components include the 9x2 speed Campagnolo Daytona group (18 speeds total), Campagnolo Athena headset and cartridge bottom bracket, Miche seatpost, Shimano SPD-S pedals, Velocity Fusion rimmed wheels with Campagnolo hubs and Vittoria Rubino 23c tires.  Size is 62cm (24.4 inches) center crank to top of seat tube. Stand-over clearance at the top tube is 33.5 inches and the bike will fit from 32 - 36 inch inseams with some variation depending on the individual.  Top tube is 58cm center-center.   The frame is constructed of Dedaccaiai Zero Uno, very light and strong Italian butted steel tubing with Columbus dropouts.  The bike weighs just under 23lbs as pictured.  The craftsmanship is very good - The joins, chrome and paintwork are excellent.   $500 cash and local pick up only please. Text and emails are preferred between 9am and 6pm.  Some background on the brand:  Vianelli bikes are more common in Italy than here in the US, they were not widely exported. Made in Brescia where Pierfranco Vianelli opened his shop after retiring from professional cycling. This bike was purchased from the original owner in Brescia.  Vianelli won the 1968 Olympics gold medal in the Individual Road Race, after he left racing he built bikes himself and also built frames for Marinoni. Later he also contracted some out to area framebuilders.  Vianelli still has a store in Brescia, now run by his son.",steel,road,special,excellent,0.0,large,special,1.0,0.0,29,1.0,0,0,0,0,20

You’re not the only one. With its blacked-out styling and great new colors for 2019, this bike will turn heads everywhere you go. And sure, the Rebel is one of our most popular bikes, but it’s also one of our most fun to ride. It has a compact frame and a low-slung seat. You can lean it over in turns due to an impressive tilt angle, and its 471cc parallel-twin engine is specially tuned for power in the middle and upper revs. Plus, it’s begging to be customized, so you can easily make it your own. Express yourself on a Rebel 500 today!Features may include:SPORTY ENGINETwin-cylinder engines are a great choice for a machine like the Rebel 500. Honda twins are famous for their versatility, and the 471cc Rebel 500’s engine is one of our best ever. The parallel-twin engine is narrow, which helps reduce overall bike size. Plus it offers lots of low-rpm torque, but plenty of higher-rpm performance.BLACKED-OUT STYLEThe Rebel is a blank canvas for your self expression. But unlike the canvas you buy at the art store, this one’s not boring white. As is, its black-out engine pieces, frame, and bodywork elements look great during the day and even better at night.LOW SEAT HEIGHTWhen it comes to seat heights, almost everyone likes them lower. At just 27.2 inches, the Rebel has one of the lowest seats in anyone’s lineup. It’s comfortable when you ride, and it makes it easier to flat-foot it at stoplights or in parking lots.SUPERIOR HANDLINGA lot of today’s motorcycles look great standing still, but disappoint once the road gets twisty. At Honda, we set high standards for the way all our bikes handle and feel, and the Rebel is a perfect example—we’ve paid just as much attention to the way this bike corners and handles as we have its knockout styling.Sunrise Pre-Owned Motorsports3201 East Park PlazaSearcy, AR 72143Ask for: Pre-Owned Sales5013052900: (501) 305-2900A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 31997213 10361078",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,0.0,unknown,unknown,0.0,0.0,unknown,0.0,0,0,0,0,23

Check out the all-new 2022 Honda Grom, probably the most fun you’ll ever have on two wheels. There’s especially big news this year, because we’ve made some huge improvements to this little pocket rocket. A new engine, with a higher 10:1 compression ratio that increases power and adds to the bike’s zippy performance. And an extra gear in the transmission—that’s right, it’s a five-speed now. Updated digital instruments. Plus a thicker, flatter seat that’s more comfortable and a better fit for taller riders. But the biggest news of all are the Grom’s new body panels. They give the Grom a fresh new look, and they’re easy to remove for customizing your ride. You even get fuel injection, a bigger fuel tank, and optional ABS. So…more comfortable, more powerful, readily customizable and a fun factor that’s off the charts—bring on the Gromance!Features may include:PERFORMANCE125cc FUEL-INJECTED ENGINEFor 2022, the Grom gets a new engine with higher compression. Nobody can match Honda’s reputation for engines, and even though the Grom may be compact, it’s a giant in terms of performance and reliability.COMFORTLOW SEAT HEIGHTAt just 30 inches the Grom makes it easy to flat-foot it in parking lots or at stop lights. Plus, the new seat is flatter and features thick padding so it’s more comfortable, especially for taller riders.ENGINEERINGHYDRAULIC DISC BRAKESThe Grom features 220mm front and 190mm rear single disc brakes for excellent stopping power.STYLEALL-NEW BODYWORKPart of the fun of owning and riding a Grom is the way it looks. So for 2022 we’ve given the Grom some tasty new bodywork. Plus, it’s easy to remove if you want to customize it even further. In addition, the engine, exhaust, wheels and swingarm are all blacked out for an edgy look.Sunrise Pre-Owned Motorsports3201 East Park PlazaSearcy, AR 72143Ask for: Pre-Owned Sales5013052900: (501) 305-2900A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 34317507 10406556",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,0.0,unknown,unknown,0.0,0.0,unknown,0.0,0,0,0,0,7

The adapter gives the bike a horizontal top tube so that the bike hangs on the rack properly. Non-standard frames are a real pain to strap onto a rack, often ending up hanging crooked and not too secure.  These are very secure. Easy to get on and off. One end of it clips on the handlebar stem under the bars and the other end clips under the seat.  The adapter telescopes longer or shorter to fit the bike.  The adapter becomes the bike's top tube that gets strapped into the rack.  I don't believe bike shops have these currently because of the shortages.   Can meet in a public place.

The bike was completely disassembled, deep cleaned, and rebuilt, piece by piece. It has new stainless steel cables, new cable housings, and new internal ball bearings. Everything works perfectly. And it rides nice and smooth.... Better than new, as mass assembled bikes don't get a mechanic's touch during build-out, often needing grease around the bearings and adjustments to most components. This one also had cheap galvanized cables on it that would rust. Those have all been replaced.  The bike has a 15 inch frame measured from the bottom bracket to the top of the seat tube. I would call this a medium size bike. A rider around 5ft5 to around 6'0 should fit fine.  The bike was completely disassembled. All the components and the drivetrain were removed, deep-cleaned, and adjusted. The front shock was removed and the headset bearings were replaced, greased, and the headset was adjusted. The wheelhub bearings were all replaced, greased, and adjusted. The internal cups and cones where all these bearings travel were all deep-cleaned to provide the cleanest and smoothest surface possible. The wheelhubs are now buttery smooth. The bottom bracket was rebuilt with new ball bearings and fresh grease, and tightened correctly. The wheels were trued, the rims and spokes were individually cleaned. The frame was cleaned and polished. The brake calipers and levers, shifters, derailleurs, cranks and chainrings, and drivetrain were all disassembled and rebuilt. There's not a nut or bolt on the bike I haven't touched.  This is a 21-speed comfort road bike with a step thru frame. The bike has street tires(700c). It has a front shock. The bike has Shimano Tourney derailleurs. It has a Shimano grip shifters. The bike has a shock absorbing seat post and matching seat and grips. The wheels have lightweight alloy rims and hubs, and have nice tires with excellent tread. The bike also has an alloy stem, alloy handlebar, and alloy seatpost to keep things light-ish. The frame is very pretty and is in like new condition.  Due to the vast amount of spam, please put the word DOG into your email and I will reply.   Use the ""more ads by this user"" link to see my other bikes. Link is located on the right side of the ad.    Old grease, combined with dirt, will harden and damage the operation of the bearings. This will cause internal damage, and can make your bike dangerous(especially with the headset bearings which allow you to steer). If you're looking to buy any used bike, find out when the last time the bearings were overhauled (not just a ""tune-up""). If it has not been done in 5 yrs, I strongly recommend having it done.",aluminum,road,unknown,unknown,0.0,small,unknown,0.0,0.0,29,0.0,0,0,0,0,2

The frame was originally red.  archive.trekbikes.com/us/en/2006/trek/madone55#/us/en/2006/trek/madone55/details When the repair was done Trek would not restore the original paint scheme or original decals to it. The owner was asked what color he preferred. Trek repainted it, and applied the decals and clear coat.   I have disassembled the frame, fork, and components. They were cleaned, regreased where needed, and reassembled.  The headset and bottom bracket are both very smooth. The frame and fork are in very pretty condition. There are some very small scuffs and scratches to the paint.  Due to the vast amount of spam, please put the word DOG into your email and I will reply.

Talk about attention to detail. Most titanium aficionados will already know what this frame is, and it really needs no introduction. But for those who don’t know, this frame features carbon main tubes and 3/2.5V titanium lugs. Mixing ti and carbon already qualifies it as exquisite, as this process isn’t often seen in many bikes. You’ll get ride qualities from both composites, and it’s an elegant way to showcase modern ways connecting with timeless design. More importantly, as you get closer to the bike, the beautifully engraved lugs begin to shine. At the head tube, seat tube and bottom bracket junctions, you’ll see meticulous craftsmanship that makes this bike more of an art piece than anything else. Dura Ace 7800 components adorn the frame; Reynolds Ouzo Pro fork, Easton carbon post and bar finish out the build.

The rear hub is a flip-flop, however, the bike is set up fixed.   The upgrades significantly help with the usability and comfort of the bike. The carbon fiber riser bars – coupled with the tires -- help to soak up the vibrations that are common with skinny tire steel-bar track bikes. Additionally, the mountain bike bars have been chopped to narrow the overall silhouette of the bike. The overall running position is now much more comfortable yet still sporty. The Paul Components brake lever helps maintain the clean lines of the cockpit while still offering the safety of a brake!

Foot pegs, mirrors, headlight screens, various handle bars and seats, new chain, green light magnets, a fork lock a speedometer and a high performance Homoet muffler, mud flaps, wind shield and more.  The rarity of the Pryor Trike makes this a super unique lot. Youre unlikely to find another for sale...anywhere. They were made in Ohio and won awards for their patended differential. This bike has custom wood floorboards and trunk. The trike was never quite the fastest moped in my collection but it is the funniest to ride and super reliable. It also easily hauls a cooler! The Sachs 5 Star General Top Tank is one of the most sought after bikes by moped enthusiasts. With a bit of wrenching, this will be well worth my entire lot's asking price on it's own. Dont believe me? Do a quick price check on these mopeds. Feel free to ask any questions, I'm not a mechanic but I'll try to answer and I'll be as honest as possible w my limited knowledge.

Moving? Upgraded? If you have LARGE items: appliances; refrigerator, washer, dryer, pool table, hot tub, sauna, large furniture items, recliner, sofa, cars, bikes, patio furniture, BBQ grill, meat smoker, golf clubs, etc. You deliver = we pay extra. We will pick it up and haul it away to donate for local charities supporting veterans and homeless kids or we buy it to place in rental houses. If it is in GOOD, (clean) working condition, I may want to buy it from you for cash today! For example: your fridge or mattress or appliance or bedroom set is less than 7 years old, and not something you would just throw out to the trash for bulk pickup, or if you are upgrading appliances / furniture and your old unit has a working, functional ice maker, it tests ""good"" as for freon and condensers and fans etc., it's not filthy with frost in the freezer or grime and slime in the refrigerator drawers... I can offer you cash if it's suitable for use or refurbishing.  Send photos of your items to this number. I buy Valley Pool tables and Diamond pool tables. a pool table is worth more if it has NEW (quality) cloth in a nice color, that won't need to be removed to move it, that has good condition rails (the cushions on pool tables last only a few years in the desert) dead-rails need replacement and that costs about $200. New felt (cloth) costs about $300 plus the cost to professionally move it, take it apart, install new cloth, rails, clean the slate, level it and repair any mechanical issues or pockets etc. so the used pool table market does not hold much value when a person can get a new custom table for only a few hundred more than your old junk pool table. Also, most ""bar"" tables are 7' foot or regulation is 9' foot and most 'house' tables are 8' foot, which is not standard to practice on for league players or pros. Most homes can only fit a 7 foot table with enough space around them. Hot tubs: most have a bad heater or bad pump or other issue and it's not worth moving. So, we can determine if your item is worth picking up for free, or if we need to charge you for our service. I have a helper to move big items, plus gas is very expensive and my truck needs maintenance and Ihaveto pay a helper, so I don't BUY your junk but most often, we can haul it away. For fast service, take photos inside and out from as many angles of your refrigerator and clean out your fridge first! Keep it running (plugged in) even if you had to move it to the garage. If it's stored outside, we probably won't want it because it tends to get mice, rats, and debris inside and it will usually be ruined, so even if you just got a new fridge and don't want to pay the delivery guy to haul away yours, just move it to the garage, call or text us, send a description: (measure it, width, heighth, depth from the wall) and describe it. Take a pic of the model and serial number inside where it shows the brand name and date it was built. text the pics to us. Schedule a pick up. It will be gone in 24 hours! I can even save you the delivery fee on your new stuff and bring that for you if you save your good working condition stuff for us. If we won't or can't move it, we will tell you why. If it's filthy, or has food or spilled liquids inside of the fridge, clean it, defrost it by pouring hot water in and soak up the drainage with towels. I will test it, check the temperature and thermostat and test the ice maker. Whatever you do keep it plugged in and don't lay it down on its back or side because it will ruin it in some cases and often we have to stand it up for at least as long as it was laying down so if you had it laying on its back for 24 hours I can't even test it for 24 hours. If it's working, you can send video or pics. Call today for free estimate! No Habla Espanol",unknown,unknown,unknown,good,0.0,unknown,unknown,0.0,0.0,unknown,0.0,0,0,0,0,2

Here is a glimpse at just the top ten uses of utility trailers:  1.Automobiles: From time to time it becomes necessary to haul an inoperable car or truck. Tow trucks are expensive, especially if the distance is great. A utility trailer is a great way to haul vehicles and a good investment if you need to do so regularly.  2.Boats: If you have a boat, you will need a utility trailer to get it to and from the water.  3.Lawn Care Equipment: If you live in a rural area, you may find that you need to haul your mowing equipment from one piece of your property to another. Packing equipment and loading it into a pickup truck bed can get old very quickly. A utility trailer will allow you to drive your equipment right up onto the trailer without the aid of ramps or two strong men.  4.Furniture: Moving furniture is a breeze with a utility trailer. Furniture dollies roll right up onto the trailer and you can haul more than you can with a pickup.  5.Building Supplies: Do you have projects that need to be done around the house? Pick up your own building supplies and save on delivery fees.  6.Bikes, Motorcycles, and ATVs: Recreational vehicles are best hauled on a utility trailer.  7.Livestock: An enclosed utility trailer is most often used to haul livestock.  8.Auction and Flea Markets: If you frequent auctions and flea markets, you will need the hauling capability to bring home your inexpensive and rare finds.  9.Appliances: Utility trailers are ideal for hauling appliances.  10.Debris and Trash: Loading trash in and out of your pickup bed can be cumbersome and clean up can be messy, but it would be worse to have to haul trash in your SUV. Clean up after a big job is a lot easier with a utility trailer.  As you can see, there are many reasons why an investment in a utility trailer is a smart move. I'm sure that with a little time, and its easy availability, you will come up with even more ways to use a trailer  ATV UTV SXS MOTORCYCLE BIKE TRANSPORT HAUL MOVE CAR TRUCK MOVING TRAVELING STORAGE CARGO LOADS AUTHORITY BOAT HAULING BUSINESS BUSINESS FOR SALE JOB SALES CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT STEEL RAZOR SNOWMOBILE POLARIS YAHAMA WILD CAT MACHINE AUTOMOBILE AUTO VAN TOWING TOW VECHICLE SNOW RAIN BOX TRUCK FLATBED GOOSNECK BUMPER PULL HITCH BALL WEATHER BUY WOOD Westchester County, NY Amawalk, Annsville, Archville, Ardsley, Ardsley-on-Hudson, Armawalk, Armonk, Arthur Manor, Banksville, Bayberry Park, Bedford, Bedford Center, Bedford Hills, Beech Hill, Beechmont, Beechmont Woods, Bonnie Crest, Boutonville, Briarcliff Manor, Bronxville, Bronxville Heights, Bryn Mawr Park, Buchanan, Buckhout Corners, Butlerville, Cecil Park, Cedar Knolls, Chappaqua, Chauncey, Chester Hill Park, Chimney Corners, Colonial Acres, Colonial Heights, Crestwood, Crestwood Gardens, Crompond, Cross River, Croton Falls, Croton Heights, Croton-on-Hudson, Crotonville, Crugers, Dobbs Ferry, Dunwoodie, Dunwoodie Heights, East Irvington, East White Plains, East Woods, Eastchester, Eastview, Elmsford, Elmsmere, Fairview, Fleetwood, Forest Knolls, Fox Meadow, Furnace Woods, Gallows Hill, Glendale, Glenville, Glenwood, Goldens Bridge, Graham, Granite Springs, Grant Corner, Greenhaven, Greenville, Grey Oaks, Greystone, Gunther Park, Harrison, Hartsdale, Hastings-on-Hudson, Hawthorne, Heath Ridge, Heathcote, Heritage Hills, Homestead Park, Horseshoe Hill, Horton Estates, Huguenot Park, Irvington, Isle of San Souci, Jefferson Valley, Katonah, Kitchawan, Lake Katonah, Lake Lincolndale, Lake Mohegan, Lake Purdy, Larchmont, Lawrence Park, Lewisboro, Lincoln, Lincolndale, Lowerre, Ludlow, Mamaroneck, Maplewood, Mariandale, Millwood, Milton, Mohegan Heights, Mohegan Lake, Montrose, Mount Airy, Mount Hope, Mount Kisco, Mount Pleasant, Mount Vernon, Murdock Woods, Murray Hill, Nepera Park, Nepperhan, New Rochelle, North Salem, North White Plains, Oceola Lake, Orienta, Oscawana, Ossining, Park Hill, Parkside, Peekskill, Pelham, Pelham Manor, Philipse Manor, Pinebrook, Pinebrook Heights, Pleasantside, Pleasantville, Pocantico Hills, Port Chester, Pound Ridge, Purchase, Purdys, Purdys Grove, Quaker Ridge, Quarry Heights, Residence Park, Ridgeway, Rochelle Heights, Rochelle Park, Roe Park, Rosedale, Rye, Rye Brook, Salem Center, Sarles Corners, Scarborough, Scarsdale, Scarsdale Downs, Scarsdale Park, Scotts Corners, Secor Gardens, Shenorock, Sherman Park, Shore Acres, Shrub Oak, Sleepy Hollow, Sleepy Hollow Manor, Somers, South Salem, Sparta, Spring Valley, Stanwood, Sun Haven, Sunny Brae, Tarrytown, Thornwood, Toddville, Tompkins Corners, Tuckahoe, Twin Lakes Village, Valhalla, Valley Pond Estates, Van Cortlandtville, Vernon Park, Verplanck, Victory Park, Vista, Waccabuc, Waverly, West Mount Vernon, White Birches, White Plains, Whitehall Corners, Wilmot Woods, Windmill Farm, Woodlands, Woodybrook, Worthington, Wykagyl, Wykagyl Park, Yonkers, Yorktown, Yorktown Heights, brooklyn, queens, manhattan, nyc, bronx, staten island, long island, hudson valley",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,0.0,unknown,unknown,0.0,0.0,unknown,0.0,0,0,0,0,5

The new engine includes a huge number of improvements, including forged pistons, an upgraded 270 degree firing order crankshaft, high strength connecting rods, closed deck cylinder, sodium filled exhaust valves and new oil system. To control the massive power delivered by the ProStar Turbo, the engine management system has also been updated to include knock detection, boost control and a high flow return style fuel system ensuring that the engine delivers maximum power under all conditions, altitudes and temperatures.INCREDIBLE TORQUE FOR ALL TYPES OF RIDINGWith 80% of torque available as early as 3500 RPMs, the RZR XP Turbo delivers remarkable performance right out of the gate and continues delivering up to 105 ft-lbs of peak torque!

The wheel size is 29inches.  I bought the bike last year for $5,000 plus tax. I’m retired and live in the Villages. I’ve only used the bike to ride on the paved trails here in the Villages and I’ve never ridden in the rain. Because of hip pain I bought a shorter crankset. I also replaced the handlebar with one that raises the hand position about an inch. I had the bike shop put on street tires to quiet the noise the off-road tires made. I installed a pair of $700 power meter pedals, a Garmin bike computer mount, mud flap for the front tire, ergonomic grips, new chain because I also installed a bigger chain ring, rearview mirror, top tube tool pouch and I replaced the factory seat with a Bontrager seat that does not go with the bike. The sale will also include two new inner tubes just in case you decide to go back to tubes. The wheels are setup as tubeless right now.   The pictures show dirt under the down tube which is also protected with a clear pain protection film. I don’t see any paint chips or scratches on the bike. If it was cleaned up it would look brand new. I don’t ride the bike with the suspension “unlocked” so the suspension hasn’t been abused.   The bike weighs about 25lbs   Here’s the Trek website link for the specs on the bike,  https://www.trekbikes.com/international/en_IN_TL/bikes/mountain-bikes/cross-country-mountain-bikes/supercaliber/supercaliber-9-7/p/28588/  I’ve got about $7,000 in the bike with the power meter pedals, tires, second set of pedals, tool pouch, extra tubes, new cranks with factory chainring and other accessories. Asking $4,900 for everything. Given the bike shortage and parts shortage this is a fair price for a lightly used bike.   If the ad is up it’s still for sale.   Not interested in parting out the bike or shipping it to your family member for a fake check. Cash only.  I prefer a text message to begin the purchase process. I live in the new section of the Villages south of the turnpike and cannot bring the bike to you as I don’t own a car.

The frame design called a Mixte, from the French word meaning ""mixed"" or ""unisex"". Was popular with quality European bicycle manufacturers; Peugeot, Gitane, Raleigh, Bianchi, and others. This classic design has made a comeback and is the new trend in stylish city bikes. It’s also popular with niche bicycle manufacturers and collectors.   This particular Mixte is rare because it was made in Japan by OMNI Bicycle Company.  Have you ever seen another OMNI bicycle from Japan? Japan was home of quality bicycle manufacturing in the 70s and 80s when Japan manufacturers Panasonic and Myiata hand-built lightweight, triple butted, lugged, Chromoly steel frames. Many were re-badged by other Japan manufacturers. I suspect that is the case with the OMNI Bicycle Company and this rare ""LA.BIKE"".    Buy this bicycle or different bike, but the idea is to get outside and ride for FUN and your good health.   Specs: •	SEITETSU Hi-Tensile seamless tubing frame and fork  •	Chrome handlebars and rims  •	Suntour components   •	Araya Wheels    •	Brand new, period correct Kenda 27 x 1 1/4 gumwall road tires and tubes   •	Rides like new  •	Comfortable upright ride position  •	Shifts smoothly  •	Stops Great   •	Cables appear to be original and in great condition  •	Original saddle is soft with no rips or blemishes    This is a 40 year-old bicycle in beautiful un-restored survivor condition with minor paint blemishes.    To avoid spam, contact must be via Craigslist email or leave me a voice message so I can call you back. No texting, this is a landline.    PH: 4-zero-7-3-two-7-2740   I will accept cash only.

This vintage 12 speed OMNI ""LA.BIKE"" is from an era of quality hand-built lightweight lugged steel frame bikes of the 1970s and 80s. The frame design called a Mixte, from the French word meaning ""mixed"" or ""unisex"", was popular with quality European bicycle companies, Peugeot, Gitane, Raleigh, Bianchi, and others. Now this classic design with its swept back handlebars is making a comeback with niche bicycle manufacturers and collectors.  This particular Mixte is rare because it was made in Japan by the OMNI Bicycle Company.  Have you ever seen another OMNI bicycle from Japan? Japan was home of quality bicycle manufacturing in the 70s and 80s when Japan manufacturers Panasonic and Myiata hand-built lightweight, triple butted, lugged, Chromoly steel frames. Many were contracted by other bicycle manufacturers and re-badged. I suspect that is the case with this OMNI ""LA.BIKE"".  Buy this bicycle or different bike, but the idea is to get outside and ride for FUN and good health. Specs: •	SEITETSU Hi-Tensile seamless tubing frame and fork •	Chrome handlebars and rims •	Suntour components  •	Araya Wheels   •	Brand new, period correct Kenda 27 x 1 1/4 gumwall road tires and tubes  •	Rides like new •	Comfortable upright ride position, fits a rider 5'3"" - 5'10 by adjusting the seat •	Shifts smoothly •	Stops as it should  •	Cables appear to be original and in excellent condition Ride it, restore it, or display this unique classic as is with its patina of a 40 year old bicycle.  To avoid spam, contact must be via Craigslist email or leave me a voice message so I can call you back. No texting, this is a landline.  PH: 4-zero-7-3-two-7-2740 I will accept $350 cash only.

The men’s bike is an 18.5 frame, the women’s bike is smaller but I am not sure of the size.  I can forward better photos if desired.  Id rather sell as a pair but I can split them up if needed.
