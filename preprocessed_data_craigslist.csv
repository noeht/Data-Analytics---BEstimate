Fast forward 40 years to today and now it’s the 29” Big Ripper that’s on top during the Big Bike BMX boom. This Big Ripper frame now comes equipped with an American bottom bracket and an OG seatstay wishbone plate just like the original PK Ripper. The 29” x 2.4” SE Bozack tires are just wide enough to give stability and cushion, but also roll extremely fast. Whether you are an old school BMX rider reliving your youth or a new school SE bike life rider raising it up, the Big Ripper is for you.     Key Features: Retro 6061 aluminum Big Ripper frame with Floval tubing, looptail rear end, American bottom bracket and classic PK Ripper wishbone plate Full Cr-Mo Landing Gear forks Cr-Mo Big Honkin’ cruiser bars Double-wall rims with sealed-bearing and high-flange hubs SE 3-piece V-Ridge cranks with alloy SE sprocket Authentic ODI Mushroom II grips with donuts SE Bozack 29” x 2.4” tires SE Flyer seat with SE bottle opener SE Racing padset (Wood Grain does not include padset) SE Wheelie pegs 32 pounds",excellent,0.0,,,,,13
