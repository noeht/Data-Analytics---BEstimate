The mountains are calling. Will you answer?  Cyberbike eBikes come all with the quietest and most powerful motor in its class, with a long range (65 miles and more) battery, and powerful e-spec hydraulic disk brakes that will be there when you need them. A lightweight package with 500 watts of power, top-of-the-line battery range, and quality components, all for the price of an inexpensive yet stellar bike!

Performance, specs, and quality components throughout, and the best warranty in the industry, from an American company with experienced American mechanics on call for all your tech support needs.  54 volt/500 watt climbing power with 13Amp hour Li-Ion battery and only 52 lbs means you'll get power and tons of battery range. Now with available throttle! Now from only $2495 Note: Owning and riding comes with risks. Wear proper protection, properly maintain and check your bike, and ride within your limits.
