I will have a 1960's Behrens Flying Eagle that has new 26""x1 3/8"" tires and tubes, is original and has been completely overhauled. It is a very smooth & efficient ride!! It is a little unusual as it has the cantilever frame design which is uncommon for a lightweight class of bicycle. It is more typical of the balloon tire bikes. I am 6' tall and have no problem comfortably riding this bike. (Red & white bike.) $225  I will also have a 1955 Raleigh Sports 3 speed that I got from a lifelong bike mechanic. He customized it with 3ttt road stem & bar for a little more room for taller people. He also customized the drivetrain with a Sugino Super Maxy crank/bb as well as a Shimano 600 Arabesque rear derailleur on a 2 speed cog on the Sturmey Archer AW 3 speed hub. I added a near new Brooks B72 saddle and new tires/tubes. Super fun bike to ride in this configuration with a purposeful look & feel!! (Black bike)$275  And finally a circa '76 Mizutani Super Seraph that has been completely overhauled with new cables, housing, tires and tubes. I also installed Velo Orange hammered alumimum fenders and updated the brake system to clean up the handlebar area to add a bottle cage or bar bag for commuting. The bike has also been deep cleaned, polished and protected to look good for a long time!! It has Ishiwata butted tubes and pretty light for a 58cm frame. This would make a sweet, fast commuter that you will not see another in the wild!!(Pink?magenta bike)$750  All prices are best offer.  I will have a couple of balloon frame/fork/tank projects and a few parts as well. If you can't make the swap, I live in Longmont and have tons of vintage bikes of all shapes and forms from muscle bikes, heavyweights, middleweights, lightweights, road bikes, etc. earlier than 1980.

I restored it myself and it has newly repacked bearings, brake pads, and brake cables. Unfortunately I hit a bump while riding it and dented the front wheel. Easy replacement if you have the same wheel. This one is a bit smaller and frame size is medium.   Brown bike is a vintage Schwinn Varsity, the back wheel axle is stripped and has been the issue since I bought it. Haven’t ridden it but can also be fixed by replacing the wheel. This one is a large frame with old school shifting.   Can be bought for parts or whole. I’m taking best offers, and yes, you can ask to buy just one.   I have ball bearings and two D-locks I can throw in part of the deal for good offers.", steel, road, Large, 18 in, cantilever,, cruiser, none (rigid),,
