Here is a glimpse at just the top ten uses of utility trailers:  1.Automobiles: From time to time it becomes necessary to haul an inoperable car or truck. Tow trucks are expensive, especially if the distance is great. A utility trailer is a great way to haul vehicles and a good investment if you need to do so regularly.  2.Boats: If you have a boat, you will need a utility trailer to get it to and from the water.  3.Lawn Care Equipment: If you live in a rural area, you may find that you need to haul your mowing equipment from one piece of your property to another. Packing equipment and loading it into a pickup truck bed can get old very quickly. A utility trailer will allow you to drive your equipment right up onto the trailer without the aid of ramps or two strong men.  4.Furniture: Moving furniture is a breeze with a utility trailer. Furniture dollies roll right up onto the trailer and you can haul more than you can with a pickup.  5.Building Supplies: Do you have projects that need to be done around the house? Pick up your own building supplies and save on delivery fees.  6.Bikes, Motorcycles, and ATVs: Recreational vehicles are best hauled on a utility trailer.  7.Livestock: An enclosed utility trailer is most often used to haul livestock.  8.Auction and Flea Markets: If you frequent auctions and flea markets, you will need the hauling capability to bring home your inexpensive and rare finds.  9.Appliances: Utility trailers are ideal for hauling appliances.  10.Debris and Trash: Loading trash in and out of your pickup bed can be cumbersome and clean up can be messy, but it would be worse to have to haul trash in your SUV. Clean up after a big job is a lot easier with a utility trailer.  As you can see, there are many reasons why an investment in a utility trailer is a smart move. I'm sure that with a little time, and its easy availability, you will come up with even more ways to use a trailer  ATV UTV SXS MOTORCYCLE BIKE TRANSPORT HAUL MOVE CAR TRUCK MOVING TRAVELING STORAGE CARGO LOADS AUTHORITY BOAT HAULING BUSINESS BUSINESS FOR SALE JOB SALES CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT STEEL RAZOR SNOWMOBILE POLARIS YAHAMA WILD CAT MACHINE AUTOMOBILE AUTO VAN TOWING TOW VECHICLE SNOW RAIN BOX TRUCK FLATBED GOOSNECK BUMPER PULL HITCH BALL WEATHER BUY WOOD Westchester County, NY Amawalk, Annsville, Archville, Ardsley, Ardsley-on-Hudson, Armawalk, Armonk, Arthur Manor, Banksville, Bayberry Park, Bedford, Bedford Center, Bedford Hills, Beech Hill, Beechmont, Beechmont Woods, Bonnie Crest, Boutonville, Briarcliff Manor, Bronxville, Bronxville Heights, Bryn Mawr Park, Buchanan, Buckhout Corners, Butlerville, Cecil Park, Cedar Knolls, Chappaqua, Chauncey, Chester Hill Park, Chimney Corners, Colonial Acres, Colonial Heights, Crestwood, Crestwood Gardens, Crompond, Cross River, Croton Falls, Croton Heights, Croton-on-Hudson, Crotonville, Crugers, Dobbs Ferry, Dunwoodie, Dunwoodie Heights, East Irvington, East White Plains, East Woods, Eastchester, Eastview, Elmsford, Elmsmere, Fairview, Fleetwood, Forest Knolls, Fox Meadow, Furnace Woods, Gallows Hill, Glendale, Glenville, Glenwood, Goldens Bridge, Graham, Granite Springs, Grant Corner, Greenhaven, Greenville, Grey Oaks, Greystone, Gunther Park, Harrison, Hartsdale, Hastings-on-Hudson, Hawthorne, Heath Ridge, Heathcote, Heritage Hills, Homestead Park, Horseshoe Hill, Horton Estates, Huguenot Park, Irvington, Isle of San Souci, Jefferson Valley, Katonah, Kitchawan, Lake Katonah, Lake Lincolndale, Lake Mohegan, Lake Purdy, Larchmont, Lawrence Park, Lewisboro, Lincoln, Lincolndale, Lowerre, Ludlow, Mamaroneck, Maplewood, Mariandale, Millwood, Milton, Mohegan Heights, Mohegan Lake, Montrose, Mount Airy, Mount Hope, Mount Kisco, Mount Pleasant, Mount Vernon, Murdock Woods, Murray Hill, Nepera Park, Nepperhan, New Rochelle, North Salem, North White Plains, Oceola Lake, Orienta, Oscawana, Ossining, Park Hill, Parkside, Peekskill, Pelham, Pelham Manor, Philipse Manor, Pinebrook, Pinebrook Heights, Pleasantside, Pleasantville, Pocantico Hills, Port Chester, Pound Ridge, Purchase, Purdys, Purdys Grove, Quaker Ridge, Quarry Heights, Residence Park, Ridgeway, Rochelle Heights, Rochelle Park, Roe Park, Rosedale, Rye, Rye Brook, Salem Center, Sarles Corners, Scarborough, Scarsdale, Scarsdale Downs, Scarsdale Park, Scotts Corners, Secor Gardens, Shenorock, Sherman Park, Shore Acres, Shrub Oak, Sleepy Hollow, Sleepy Hollow Manor, Somers, South Salem, Sparta, Spring Valley, Stanwood, Sun Haven, Sunny Brae, Tarrytown, Thornwood, Toddville, Tompkins Corners, Tuckahoe, Twin Lakes Village, Valhalla, Valley Pond Estates, Van Cortlandtville, Vernon Park, Verplanck, Victory Park, Vista, Waccabuc, Waverly, West Mount Vernon, White Birches, White Plains, Whitehall Corners, Wilmot Woods, Windmill Farm, Woodlands, Woodybrook, Worthington, Wykagyl, Wykagyl Park, Yonkers, Yorktown, Yorktown Heights, brooklyn, queens, manhattan, nyc, bronx, staten island, long island, hudson valley",,

It's been well cared for and is a blast to ride. It comes with many recent upgrades and a bunch of extras. Components are a mix including XTR, XX1, and a carbon wheel. I have a tendency to stockpile spare parts so that I can swap them in when it's time instead of waiting, so you won't have to spend money on this bike for quite some time. Carbon all across the front end.  The fork has some damage to one stanchion. I'll get a photo posted soon. I've polished the dings which makes them look worse, but perform better. The scratches happened almost three years ago and when seals have been replaced, there is no visible damage to the seals or fluid loss from that side. They were really upsetting when it happened, but those scratches have been completely forgotten by now.  The most recent services were Spring and Fall of 2021:  Spring 2021 - Full overhaul of fork, damper inspection, airspring o-rings and wiper seals replaced. Air cartridge and wiper seals replaced in the seatpost w/ new cable and housing. SRAM DUB bottom bracket and cranks installed w/ new chainring and chain. XX1 shifter installed. New Blunt 35 rim laced to existing Tune rear hub. New rear cassette.  Fall 2021 - Lower leg service on fork. New X01 derailleur and new derailleur hanger. New headset.  Carbon front triangle, aluminum rear Carbon handlebars RockShox Pike 160 fork, solo air CB Highline 160mm dropper post w/ CB remote Shimano SLX brakes, XTR lever for the rear. 180mm rotors SRAM Dub bottom bracket, replaced Spring 2021. SRAM direct-mount cranks. 30t OneUp chainring. X01 derailleur. XX1 shifter Kong tune hubs with Enve M60 Forty front rim and Velocity Blunt 35 rear Brand new Maxxis Aggressor 2.5 front, lightly used Aggressor 2.5 on the rear.  Extras: 2 pair brake pads, nearly new cassette, extra CB dropper wiper, Banjo Bros frame bag. I have a full set of new pivot bearing for the whole rear linkage that I just haven't installed yet. I can install them, or provide them for you to take care of in another year.  I'm out here visiting right now with the bike, but many of the extras are back in my garage.  If you buy the bike, I'll ship out a box when I get home in two weeks.  In addition to what's listed, I have extra wheels that I can add in so you have a backup or can have two types of tires ready to go and swap them according to trail conditions.   Extra wheelset: American Classic 23mm rim depth wheels Additional front wheel - Hope hub with Stan's rim all wheels are taped and sealed with valve stems.",,

The 2008 Jaguar X-type runs like a top. The Power steering hose popped, and I just took it off and ordered a new one. New A/C, flushed the system accumulator, pump, orifice, condenser. New emission systems, and new complete radiator, all hoses, and pipes and o rings. New water pump.  I have to smog it, or you can for the discount. $3000.00 if you smog it, $4000 if I do. 176k miles  The 2002 X-type needs a fuel pump or fuse, or relay or module. I haven't had time to do a diagnostic test to see which it is. Worse case scenario, drop the tank and put a fuel pump in for a few hundred bucks.  I just did the front end, cv axels, struts, ball joints and arms, A/C with pump, dryer, orifice, flushed the system.  $2500.00 on non op, runs with starter fluid. Bring a can and it runs like a top.  2004 Ranger FX4 video of truck here   https://youtu.be/z9JzoeA1XQg   Rebuilt Transmission and Transfer case, and I put a new slave cylinder/throwout bearing, master cylinder, clutch and flywheel, and the transmission is great now. I have a new radiator, and water pump I put in that a while back. I did the front bearings, and everything else is running great.  It has 275k miles, but keeps on ticking. So, that motor is good. I just put new plugs and wires on it. It's the heavy duty FX4 model 4x4, and really is a work horse. It has a lumber rack, about 1500 con truck from auburn as they are the best! $4500  The Harley Davidson Road King is a 2005 with 30k miles. It runs great with no issues at all. I've changed the oil bi-annually, and the transmission fluid frequently.   The neat thing about this Harley is that I bought a paint kit OEM factor identical to when I bought it. It is smokey gold, and so is the brand new paint kit, which consists of fuel tank, side panels, bags (hard), and front and back fender. I haven't put them on yet, but I can. I thought I'd get a few more scratches and dents and switch them out when I bore out the motor bigger. It will be IN SHOW ROOM CONDITION FOR A 15 year old bike. It has a tour box removable, and that did not come with the OEM new stuff I have. I want 10 grand for the bike with the $2000 paint kit tossed in, so you get a new looking bike when your ready to put some more thunder in it.     I'll get some pics up soon.   Let me know if your interested in any of these.",,
