Dry weight is about 3800lbs, Has a bunk house, queen bed, full table, kitchen, bathroom with shower and tub that I can fit in(6'2""). Lots of storage, has awning with led lights, outdoor speakers and a lot more that I am missing. The person I purchased this from had custom ramps made to fit a SxS on it. Also added a hitch receiver to the rear as well so you can add more fun to it if you want. You can fit 2 ATVs on it, a SxS, and I've had 3 bikes on it as well. I'll attach photos of it all loaded up. We have taken good care of it and it has no issues. Everything is working great. It's a very unique setup and the space is utilized very well. Respond to this listing if you have any questions.

It has a little over 14,100 miles on it. I’m selling it because my back is messed up and I haven’t been able to ride it around without being in a lot of pain so it’s been sitting for awhile.  The bike itself runs great. It needs to be lubed up in one area for a small squeak  but besides that it is mechanically in good shape. It spent most of its time in a barn so it’s a bit dusty but she starts right up and the tires have alot of life left in them. The body is in good shape with the exception of one small dent on the tank and the floor board on the left side is missing one bolt but that bolt will be in the mail in the next few days.  The bike comes with two seats the original Silverado seat and the stinger seat. If you know anything about bikes you know seats are not cheap and you get two with this one. The stinger is great for around town but the Silverado seat is big and wide for those long rides which is what is on it right now. I’d hate to sell it because it’s a great bike but I hate seeing it just sit. This bike is comparable to a road king in size  it is not small by any means.  Asking $3400 or Best offer takes her.

Requests his step-father go with him and help him buy the best bike for his planned career.  He wants to be a Courier, and wants the best bike they can find.  At a local hardware store in Colorado Springs they find it. It's a gold colored AMF Roadmaster Courier 3. The perfect bike for the position of a Courier a - 3 speed bicycle. The young man's plan is to be a courier until he finds a college that he will go to. He is hired as a courier and his dream starts for the next 2 years he rides his licensed Courier 3 bicycle. The odometer says a total of  179.9 miles.  After 2 years he decides to enlist in the Service, He is sent to Vietnam. He does not come home.  His mother and stepfather, decide to place his things in his bedroom and wait for his return. Fast forward to 2019 His stepfather passes away, followed by within 6 months of his mother's passing.

This is great for a collection, or is great for someone who wants to ride and enjoy it.  **And it can be yours if the price is right.** All original with the exception of tires, and tubes, (though I put on period correct that I searched out and found).  It has an odometer of that time period, as well as the caliper brakes, and buckhorn handle bars that came on it.

It’s everything that makes Bowtech bows the most accurate in the world, and then some. No ladies bow on the market even comes close. Designed in conjunction with its namesake, the new Eva Shockey Signature Series Gen II is smooth, hard-hitting, deadly accurate, and weighs in at a mere 3.9 pounds; thanks to its feather-light, yet rock-solid riser. With the addition of the most reliably accurate cam system in the world, it has no equal.  Dead Lock Cams: Not only the quickest and simplest way to achieve perfect arrow flight, but the surest way to maintain it. Just move the cams left or right on the axles with a turn of a screw to position all the energy directly behind the arrow. Then lock it down for permanent, repeatable accuracy…all with a smooth-as-silk draw and outstanding speed.  Dead Lock Pocket: Dead Lock limb pockets lock every component in the entire bow structure as one for the most rigid, accuracy-producing platform possible.	  Dead Lock Cable Containment: The reduced torque translates to added forgiveness and dramatically enhanced shot-to-shot consistency.  Clutch Performance Grip: The most comfortable modular grips on the market are engineered to reduce torque while increasing comfort. Our low-profile Clutch grip comes standard. The Clutch Control grip is available for purchase separately. Both grips are available in 4 popular colors.

Please verify that the connector you see in the picture matches the receptacle on your golf cart (see pictures). Please note: We carry every charger/connector plug combination so if you do not see the combination for your cart, it's just that we did not post a picture; we have every combination in stock.  SMART CHARGER FEATURES: MAINTENANCE MODE (AUTOMATIC STOP / RESTART): Automatically stops charging when the batteries are fully charged and continues monitoring the battery's voltage and restarts charging automatically when it detects a preset voltage drop, replenishing energy with pulse current.

Prevents new batteries from becoming sulfated and rejuvenates older good working batteries by automatically dissolving harmful sulfation, by using safe high-frequency pulse technology. Patented WAVE Technology increases battery efficiency, extends battery life by 2-3 times and keeps batteries from failing prematurely due to suffocating sulfate crystals, hence reducing early battery replacement costs OVERCHARGE PROTECTION: Never worry about overcharging, as the charger automatically stops when batteries reach set voltage. Should you have a bad battery or batteries, the charger will safely and optimally charge the batteries without overcharging the good batteries EXTENDS THE WORKING LIFE OF YOUR BATTERIES: The Smart Charging characteristics of our Desulfating Battery Charger will dramatically increase the life of the batteries ELECTRICITY SAVINGS: Rejuvenated batteries charge quicker and reduce electricity consumption NO SPARK CHARGING, REVERSE POLARITY AND SHORT CIRCUIT PROTECTION: Prevents the output leads from sparking due to accidental reverse connection or short circuit DIGITAL AMP/VOLTMETER: Displays charge VOLTAGE, CURRENT and other useful information such as battery test and protection codes COMPACT AND CONVENIENT & EFFICIENT Small and light, adopting switch-mode technology aka Switching Power Supply.

Here is a glimpse at just the top ten uses of utility trailers:  1.Automobiles: From time to time it becomes necessary to haul an inoperable car or truck. Tow trucks are expensive, especially if the distance is great. A utility trailer is a great way to haul vehicles and a good investment if you need to do so regularly.  2.Boats: If you have a boat, you will need a utility trailer to get it to and from the water.  3.Lawn Care Equipment: If you live in a rural area, you may find that you need to haul your mowing equipment from one piece of your property to another. Packing equipment and loading it into a pickup truck bed can get old very quickly. A utility trailer will allow you to drive your equipment right up onto the trailer without the aid of ramps or two strong men.  4.Furniture: Moving furniture is a breeze with a utility trailer. Furniture dollies roll right up onto the trailer and you can haul more than you can with a pickup.  5.Building Supplies: Do you have projects that need to be done around the house? Pick up your own building supplies and save on delivery fees.  6.Bikes, Motorcycles, and ATVs: Recreational vehicles are best hauled on a utility trailer.  7.Livestock: An enclosed utility trailer is most often used to haul livestock.  8.Auction and Flea Markets: If you frequent auctions and flea markets, you will need the hauling capability to bring home your inexpensive and rare finds.  9.Appliances: Utility trailers are ideal for hauling appliances.  10.Debris and Trash: Loading trash in and out of your pickup bed can be cumbersome and clean up can be messy, but it would be worse to have to haul trash in your SUV. Clean up after a big job is a lot easier with a utility trailer.  As you can see, there are many reasons why an investment in a utility trailer is a smart move. I'm sure that with a little time, and its easy availability, you will come up with even more ways to use a trailer  ATV UTV SXS MOTORCYCLE BIKE TRANSPORT HAUL MOVE CAR TRUCK MOVING TRAVELING STORAGE CARGO LOADS AUTHORITY BOAT HAULING BUSINESS BUSINESS FOR SALE JOB SALES CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT STEEL RAZOR SNOWMOBILE POLARIS YAHAMA WILD CAT MACHINE AUTOMOBILE AUTO VAN TOWING TOW VECHICLE SNOW RAIN BOX TRUCK FLATBED GOOSNECK BUMPER PULL HITCH BALL WEATHER BUY WOOD Westchester County, NY Amawalk, Annsville, Archville, Ardsley, Ardsley-on-Hudson, Armawalk, Armonk, Arthur Manor, Banksville, Bayberry Park, Bedford, Bedford Center, Bedford Hills, Beech Hill, Beechmont, Beechmont Woods, Bonnie Crest, Boutonville, Briarcliff Manor, Bronxville, Bronxville Heights, Bryn Mawr Park, Buchanan, Buckhout Corners, Butlerville, Cecil Park, Cedar Knolls, Chappaqua, Chauncey, Chester Hill Park, Chimney Corners, Colonial Acres, Colonial Heights, Crestwood, Crestwood Gardens, Crompond, Cross River, Croton Falls, Croton Heights, Croton-on-Hudson, Crotonville, Crugers, Dobbs Ferry, Dunwoodie, Dunwoodie Heights, East Irvington, East White Plains, East Woods, Eastchester, Eastview, Elmsford, Elmsmere, Fairview, Fleetwood, Forest Knolls, Fox Meadow, Furnace Woods, Gallows Hill, Glendale, Glenville, Glenwood, Goldens Bridge, Graham, Granite Springs, Grant Corner, Greenhaven, Greenville, Grey Oaks, Greystone, Gunther Park, Harrison, Hartsdale, Hastings-on-Hudson, Hawthorne, Heath Ridge, Heathcote, Heritage Hills, Homestead Park, Horseshoe Hill, Horton Estates, Huguenot Park, Irvington, Isle of San Souci, Jefferson Valley, Katonah, Kitchawan, Lake Katonah, Lake Lincolndale, Lake Mohegan, Lake Purdy, Larchmont, Lawrence Park, Lewisboro, Lincoln, Lincolndale, Lowerre, Ludlow, Mamaroneck, Maplewood, Mariandale, Millwood, Milton, Mohegan Heights, Mohegan Lake, Montrose, Mount Airy, Mount Hope, Mount Kisco, Mount Pleasant, Mount Vernon, Murdock Woods, Murray Hill, Nepera Park, Nepperhan, New Rochelle, North Salem, North White Plains, Oceola Lake, Orienta, Oscawana, Ossining, Park Hill, Parkside, Peekskill, Pelham, Pelham Manor, Philipse Manor, Pinebrook, Pinebrook Heights, Pleasantside, Pleasantville, Pocantico Hills, Port Chester, Pound Ridge, Purchase, Purdys, Purdys Grove, Quaker Ridge, Quarry Heights, Residence Park, Ridgeway, Rochelle Heights, Rochelle Park, Roe Park, Rosedale, Rye, Rye Brook, Salem Center, Sarles Corners, Scarborough, Scarsdale, Scarsdale Downs, Scarsdale Park, Scotts Corners, Secor Gardens, Shenorock, Sherman Park, Shore Acres, Shrub Oak, Sleepy Hollow, Sleepy Hollow Manor, Somers, South Salem, Sparta, Spring Valley, Stanwood, Sun Haven, Sunny Brae, Tarrytown, Thornwood, Toddville, Tompkins Corners, Tuckahoe, Twin Lakes Village, Valhalla, Valley Pond Estates, Van Cortlandtville, Vernon Park, Verplanck, Victory Park, Vista, Waccabuc, Waverly, West Mount Vernon, White Birches, White Plains, Whitehall Corners, Wilmot Woods, Windmill Farm, Woodlands, Woodybrook, Worthington, Wykagyl, Wykagyl Park, Yonkers, Yorktown, Yorktown Heights, brooklyn, queens, manhattan, nyc, bronx, staten island, long island, hudson valley",,,,,,,,,,,
