From weekend roads to everyday roads, from city streets to twisting country highways. With a comfortable riding position, a dry weight of just 184 kg and the impressive performance of the Testastretta 11¬∞ engine, every ride becomes an opportunity to indulge your sporting instinct. Wherever, whenever, the SuperSport makes every motorcyclist a real rider: whichever road you take, get ready to experience it as never before.DesignThe Ducati Design Center has come up with a dynamic, polished, visually compact, light machine that is Ducati to the core.A front-on look shows it has a distinct 'family feel' with the Panigale superbike. In addition to the highly distinctive LED Daytime Running Light (DRL), the headlight's low and high beam parabolas are positioned in the shadows of the assembly, almost hiding them from direct frontal view: just like those mounted on the top Ducati sports models.Low-set, streamlined and assertive, the SuperSport nose fairing flows naturally into the steel fuel tank structure, carrying the colour scheme all the way into the well-designed cockpit that houses the LCD instrument panel. A sports-style Plexiglas screen with two different height settings ensures aerodynamically efficient airflow protection.Seen side-on, the lines, proportions and volumes are typical of Ducati sports bikes, with the streamlined tail and sculpted tank playing a pivotal role. The latter is coupled to both the main and nose fairings by beefy buttresses that enclose the Trellis frame. Cut to reveal exhaust manifold and engine, the lower fairing is designed to be easy on the eye, a must on a Ducati SuperSport.Ducati's conscientious attention to technical components is also seen in the compact, sports-style stacked dual-pipe side muffler. Shaping and low-slung design bring out the dynamism of the tail, leaving the rear wheel Y-spokes in clear view and providing plenty of room for side panniers (available as accessories).Testastretta 11¬∞The SuperSport is powered by a specially adapted version of the already renowned and appreciated 937 cm3 twin-cylinder Ducati Testastretta 11¬∞. Euro 4-rated, it has four valves per cylinder, a secondary air system, liquid cooling, a 12.6:1 compression ratio and bore and stroke measurements of 94 and 67.5 mm respectively. Engine output amounts to a huge 113 hp at 9, 000 rpm and a maximum torque of 96.7 Nm at 6,500 rpm.On the SuperSport, the Testastretta 11¬∞ engine features crankcase and cylinder heads that have been redesigned to make the power unit an integral part of the frame; further modifications include re-routing of the water through the heads and a specifically designed alternator cover to allow installation of the new gear sensor. Large 53 mm throttle bodies - smoothly controlled by the full Ride-by-Wire system - allow the engine to gulp in the air-fuel mix. Moreover, this engine also features unprecedented control and injection systems.

We've kept all the modern comforts where they belong‚Äîbelow the surface of a rad, vintage-looking bike. You get the classic lines of a vintage ""hardtail"" frame with the horizontal rear shocks hidden in the guts. It's a signature rigid look, and you'll only find it on a Softail¬Æ model.Nostalgic Custom StyleDo laced wheels, whitewalls and studded leather add to the way a bike feels on the road? Of course they do. It's these extras that make the Heritage Softail¬Æ Classic model the quintessential boulevard cruiser. As rallies were gaining grassroots traction in the '40s, you'd roll into Daytona Bike Week expecting new stories and new styles. There was really something going on, and it's still alive and well in this bike. Take the saddlebags, studded with style straight from that golden era, with hidden quick-detach buckles. Or the fenders‚Äîfull and fluid, with chrome highlights and matching paint. Or that big, commanding 7-inch ball headlamp, chromed and classy. And let's talk wheels. You can go with the standard steel-laced wheels on blackwalls with a chrome hub. Or turn the clock all the way back with the optional chrome laces and wide whitewalls.Old-School Tank and 3-D MedallionThe unique medallion on the Heritage Softail¬Æ Classic motorcycle is glass-inlayed, cloisonn√©-and-chrome style and shows that Harley-Davidson¬Æ Softail¬Æ model heritage that runs in your blood. With a five-gallon capacity for long weekend cruising, we top off this tank with a nostalgic chrome ""cats-eye"" console, paint for days and style to spare.Tank-Mounted ConsoleThe speedometer face boasts a big, bold display for the odometer, along with an ancillary display for gear and rpm, offering up the information you need on the fly.Tombstone TaillightA vintage classic. The chrome, low profile taillight housing lays back against the fender but shines with Harley-Davidson history. Flanked by our sleek silver bullet turn signals, that glowing red gravestone is the last thing they'll see as you pull away into the night.Whitewall TiresOne of the defining styling features of the Softail¬Æ Deluxe model is the nostalgic wide whitewall tires with premium laced wheels. A nod to the ‚Äò50s boulevard look, these fat rubber rollers are just the right throwback detail from Harley-Davidson that ups the ante in any scene. Total old-school styling without sacrificing handling or performance.Hard Candy Custom‚Ñ¢ PaintHard Candy Custom‚Ñ¢ is a large metal flake finish that‚Äôs more than just paint job, it‚Äôs a shining declaration of independence‚Äîbright, bold and unique. The Softail Deluxe is available in Hard Candy Cancun Blue Flake. Recalling the iconic rebel styling of ‚Äò70s custom bikes, Hard Candy Custom marks another milestone in The Motor Company‚Äôs legacy of innovation. We start with several passes of 200 micron flake over a silver base, then clear coat it, hand-lay and mask the pattern and apply the Candy color to allow the flake to shine through.

Maybe it‚Äôs your brother-in-law, or your neighbor, or some guy at your workplace. He‚Äôs always telling you what he‚Äôs going to do . . . but he never really does anything.But there‚Äôs another kind of guy too‚Äîsomeone who turns every day into something that‚Äôs fun. Every weekend he comes back with a story to tell, even if he never crossed a state line.Honda¬Æ‚Äôs new VFR¬Æ1200X is built for people who know adventure isn‚Äôt someplace you go, it‚Äôs what you do getting there. It‚Äôs an excellent machine for exploring the world around you, and doing it in comfort, confidence, and style. Sporty, athletic, nimble enough for around-town cruising or tight winding back roads, it‚Äôs also big enough to reel in those highway miles, and see the Statue of Liberty, Mount Rushmore, and the Alamo all in the same trip.And the new VFR¬Æ1200X is loaded with features too‚Äîthe most important being its 1237cc V4 engine and choice of six-speed transmissions. Best of all, we‚Äôre offering a ton of accessories, so you can fine-tune it to how you want to ride.Where will a new 2016 Honda¬Æ VFR¬Æ1200X take you? Wherever adventure calls.Features May Include:1237cc V4 EngineDrawing on 30 years of V4 technology and racing success, Honda¬Æ designers gave the VFR¬Æ1200X what is one of our most advanced streetbike engines yet: a fuel-injected, liquid-cooled 1237cc, 76-degree V-4 brimming with low-end torque.Transmission ChoicesYou can choose between a conventional six-speed manual transmission or our latest, third-generation Honda¬Æ Automatic DCT transmission. With the DCT, you upshift or downshift with a pair of paddle-style buttons, or you can let the gearbox shift for itself.43mm Inverted ForkWho knows where you‚Äôll be riding, but the VFR¬Æ1200X‚Äôs suspension is up to the job. The 43mm KYB fork is adjustable for spring preload as well as rebound damping, and is plenty stiff for steering precision.Pro-Link Rear SuspensionThe KYB shock on the VFR¬Æ1200X‚Äôs rear suspension is adjustable for rebound damping and features a convenient no-tool preload adjuster making it easy to fine-tune the ride for varying loads.Single-Sided SwingarmThe final-drive assembly runs right through the single-sided aluminum swingarm housing, making rear-wheel removal a snap.Dual Front DiscsThe twin front brakes use huge 310mm discs for plenty of fade-free stopping power. Combined ABS is a standard feature.Aluminum FrameThe VFR¬Æ1200X‚Äôs twin-spar aluminum frame members are fine-tuned to offer very precise control over weight and rigidity, and form the foundation of the bike‚Äôs stellar handling.Selectable Torque ControlHonda¬Æ's Selectable Torque Control system (HSTC) is designed to help riders adapt to multiple traction conditions. With the push of a button the VFR¬Æ1200X's (HSTC) lets you choose from three levels of engine-torque The system can also be turned off according to rider preference. Available on both manual-transmission and Automatic DCT versions of the VFR¬Æ1200X.One-Hand Adjustable WindscreenIt couldn‚Äôt be easier to adjust the new VFR¬Æ1200X‚Äôs windscreen. One hand and a couple of seconds is all you‚Äôll need.
