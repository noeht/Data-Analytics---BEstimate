It's equally at home hauling loose brush loads or heavy equipment. Based on an 8"" I-beam frame, the DJX includes heavy-duty features like an industry-leading 6"" scissor hoist. We house the KTI hydraulic pump and Interstate battery in a unique full-width, internally split toolbox. This protects the heart of the hydraulics system and provides a convenient place for chains and other important tools. You can also choose to outfit the DJX with 2', 3' or 4' tall Tuff Sides. These sides provide a massive 3"" top cap surface that wraps partially down the side of the trailer. These top rails are then supported with flared steel side supports. Combined, they help form a bed that's extremely resistant to warping, dents, and damage. All of our dumps come equipped with tarp-kits as a standard feature. We build each DJX with a standard GVWR of 14,000 lbs and twin 7K Dexter electric brake axles. You can configure these versatile dumps in lengths of 12', 14, and 16 with base weights ranging from 4,150 lbs to 4,550 lbs. Like all MAXX-D Trailers, the DJX I-beam dump model is finished with our industry-leading powder coating process. Six different steps all work together to give your trailer a premium powder-coated steel surface with unmatched durability. Through our expansive dealer network, we give you the option to configure your DJX low profile dump trailer with a variety of options to fit your needs. Whether it's an extra set of D-rings, solar battery charger, or your choice of side height and configuration, you can get a DJX that's perfect for whatever it is you're building. With both gooseneck and bumper pull styles available, the DJX is an ideal choice for construction, roofing, agriculture, landscaping, and any other large projects you can dream of. Build something great with a DJX I-beam dump trailer!Trailer InfoStock #: 88959VIN: 5R8BD1422NM088959Condition: NewTrailer DetailsType: Trailers2022 MAXXD TRAILERS 14'X83 DJX I BEAM DUMP UNKNOWN Call California Custom at (916) 694-0373 ext 214 https://calcustomtrailers.com/dx1inventory/4737e539-7fef-4e4d-bb16-add5011a804f$15,095 **Prices listed are the MSRP or sale price and do not include any taxes, fees, or installed accessories.

For 2013, the Electra Glide® Ultra Limited model comes in a limited, serialized 110th Anniversary Special Edition, featuring exclusive commemorative anniversary styling elements and premium features that make it a top-of-the-line model and a true work of living art, with finely forged finishes that age and transform in a manner unique to each vehicle. Some of the bike's premium features include: air-cooled Twin Cam 103™ engine for powerful performance, ABS brakes, heated hand grips, titanium face gauges, Tour-Pak inserts, a premium Tour-Pak luggage rack, 28-Spoke contrast chrome wheels, and special Ultra Limited identifier medallions. Also found on the Harley® Electra Glide® Ultra touring bike is a 6 gallon fuel tank so you have to stop less for fuel. Harley® has many other motorcycle touring bikes, all to provide you with comfort and style. Be sure to look at the Road Glide Ultra with its frame mounted Harley® fairing for your motorcycle travel as well as all of the other H-D® touring motorcycles.110th Anniversary Gas Tank Medallion (Optional)Each Anniversary Edition Harley-Davidson® is a unique masterpiece, with its very own work of art marking it as part of this historic celebration. Forged of solid bronze and plated with black nickel, each Anniversary medallion is then distressed to highlight the bronze. And since no two can ever distress the same, each becomes a completely unique commemorative ""sculpture."" The finishing touch is a bold gold Cloisonné showing the Harley-Davidson® Bar and Shield. (Available only on 110th Anniversary Edition models)Twin Cam 103™ Engine HeritageThe knowledge of what makes an engine truly move a rider runs deep at The Motor Company, and it was put to good use when we created the Twin Cam 103™ engine. We painstakingly perfected every cubic inch, pushing design and technology forward—all without compromising one bit of Harley-Davidson®'s unique styling. Evolved, yet carrying on the legacy of the Flathead, Knucklehead, Panhead, Shovelhead, Evolution®, Twin Cam 88® and Twin Cam 96™ engines that came before. The performance and durability are a direct result of the untold miles logged on the V-Twin since 1909, and the proud heritage that comes from a century's worth of commitment to life on two wheels.Harman/Kardon® Advanced Audio SystemNaturally, the king of the road gets some royal extras. The premium two-speaker, 20-watt per channel Harman/Kardon® audio system boasts great sound for booming down the boulevard and highway, and, yeah, it might as well go to 11. It's loud, proud and comes with AM/FM receiver and accommodates a CD or MP3 player. Riding free just wouldn't be the same without the right soundtrack.Dunlop® Multi-Tread™ TiresThe 180mm back tire is engineered to do more than fill out the rear fender and put a bigger patch of rubber on the road. Dunlop® Multi-Tread™ technology uses harder compounds at the center and softer on the sides for a tire that still knows how to knuckle-down on corners. Perfect for making this bike agile on every curvy stretch of road. And the way it feels going through an abrupt off-camber turn will put a grin on your face that'll last to the next state line.Enter this link to see more images plus all other inventory we have available: http://lyv.cc/U9DHBBasic Information:Year: 2013Make: Harley-Davidson®Model: FLHTK - Electra Glide Ultra LimitedStock Number: U09902Condition: UsedType: TouringMileage: 42,079Title: CleanColor: Blue/BlackBrakes:ABS BrakesBrake Brand Name: BremboFront Brake: Dual Hydraulic DiscFront Brake Diameter (in): 11.5Front Brake Diameter (mm): 292.1Linked Brake System Front to RearRear Brake: Hydraulic DiscRear Brake Diameter (in): 11.5Rear Brake Diameter (mm): 292.1Chassis & Suspension:Air Adjustable Rear SuspensionFrame: SteelFront Adjustable Rebound DampingFront Suspension Type: Telescopic ForkNumber Rear Shock Absorbers: 2Rear Adjustable Rebound DampingRear Adjustable Shock / Spring Pre-LoadRear Suspension Material: SteelRear Suspension Type: Twin Sided Swing ArmComfort:CB RadioCruise ControlDigital InstrumentationHeated Hand Grip Location: DriverIntercomOil Pressure GaugeNumber Of Speakers: 4Trip OdometerRadio Brand Name: Harman/KardonSeat BackrestDrivetrain:Heel Toe ShifterNumber Of Speeds: 6Primary Drive (Rear Wheel): BeltTransmission: ManualPrimary Drive (Engine / Transmission): ChainTransmission Gear Ratio (1): 9.59Transmission Gear Ratio (2): 6.65Transmission Gear Ratio (3): 4.94Transmission Gear Ratio (4): 4Transmission Gear Ratio (5): 3.41Transmission Gear Ratio (6): 2.86Engine:Bore (in): 3.88Bore (mm): 98.5Carburetion Type: Fuel InjectedCompression Ratio: 9.6Cooling System: AirCylinders: 2Engine Brand Name: Twin Cam 103Engine Disp. to Weight (cc): 1.91Engine ImmobilizerEngine Immobilizer Brand: Digitally Encoded Security System (DESS)Engine Size (cc): 1687Engine Size (ci): 103Engine Stroke: 4-StrokeEngine Type: V TwinFuel Capacity (gal): 6Fuel InjectorFuel Requirements: PremiumStarter: ElectricStroke (in): 4.38Stroke (mm): 111.3Torque (Ft Lbs): 100Torque (Nm): 135.6Torque RPM: 3250US Miles Per Gallon (Combined): 42Valve Configuration: OHV - PushrodValves: 4Valves Per Cylinder: 2Other Information:Bag LinersBag Liner Material: VinylChassis ProtectorsChromed WheelsEngine Case GuardExterior CoversExterior GuardsFloor BoardsFront FenderFront Fender RailFront Fender TrimGlove Box / Dash StorageHand GripsHard Side CasesHard Side Case Location: Left and Right SideHard Side Case Number: 2Helmet StorageLockable StorageLower FairingSaddle Bag GuardSide CoverRear FenderRear Fender TrimRear RackRear Rack StorageSide Storage MountSide Case MountStandStand Type: KickTool Bag MountUpper FairingTank DividerTank Divider Material: LeatherWind DeflectorWindshieldWindshield Brand: Lexan®Windshield MountsSafety:HeadlightHeadlight Mounting BarHeadlight Type: HalogenFuel Level WarningRearview MirrorsPassing LampsSpecifications:Dry Weight (kg): 400.1Dry Weight (lbs): 882Front Tire (Full Spec): Dunlop Multi-Tread 130/80 R17 65HFront Tire (Inches): 17Front Tire Aspect Ratio: 80Front Tire Width: 130Fuel Capacity (liters): 22Ground Clearance (in): 5.1Ground Clearance (mm): 129.5Length (inches): 98Length (mm): 2504.4Rear Tire (Full Spec): Dunlop Multi-Tread 180/65 R16 81HRear Tire (Inches): 16Rear Tire Aspect Ratio: 65Rear Tire Speed Rating: 81HRear Tire Width: 180Seat Height (inches): 29Wet Weight (kg): 413.2Wet Weight (lbs): 911Wheelbase (in): 63.5Wheelbase (mm): 1612.9Wheels Composition: AluminumSpeedometerTachometerHarley-Davidson of Folsom115 Woodmere RoadFolsom, CA 95630Ask for: Sales DepartmentMain: (916) 608-9922A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 33973357 10402348",,,,,,,,,,,

Some of the bike's premium features include: air-cooled Twin Cam 103 engine for powerful performance, ABS brakes, heated hand grips, titanium face gauges, Tour-Pak inserts, a premium Tour-Pak luggage rack, 28-Spoke contrast chrome wheels, and special Ultra Limited identifier medallions. Also found on the Harley® Electra Glide® Ultra touring bike is a 6 gallon fuel tank so you have to stop less for fuel. Harley® has many other motorcycle touring bikes, all to provide you with comfort and style.Features may include:CLASSIC FUEL TANKPart of the unmistakable style of the Harley-Davidson® Electra Glide® Ultra Limited motorcycle is plenty of room for showing off your paint. This classically styled, bold six-gallon fuel tank doesn't just give you a bigger canvas for premium or custom paint; it holds six gallons of go so you can eat up a lot more road between pit stops. We know fuel economy is important—but so is style. A dual-color paint scheme, crisp pinstripes that run the length of the bike and special Harley-Davidson® tank medallions give this ride a one-of-a-kind look.BAT-WING FAIRINGDesigned by Chief Styling Officer Willie G. Davidson, the nimble, fork-mounted Bat-Wing fairing first appeared on the touring scene back in 1969. And it continues to evolve and symbolize the essence of Grand American Touring motorcycles more than forty years later. The full 8-inch windscreen gives it that classic touring profile and additional comfort. Simply put, the wind is not a factor for the mile-hungry rider who wants to soak up the freedom of the open road for days on end.GTX® SADDLEBAGS AND TOUR-PAK®These injection-molded hard bags have room for 2.26 cu. ft. volume of long-haul luxuries and a perfect surface for showing off some premium paint. Even better, these saddlebags open from the top, so your gear won't end up spilled all over the highway. They keep your fancy unmentionables dry, and the chrome latches won't corrode in bad weather. And when you're off the road, one common key starts the bike and gives you access to your saddlebags, keeping your pockets as uncluttered as your bike's classic design. The premium Tour-Pak® luggage carrier is an extra perk, adding to the luxury look and giving you even more space to pack stuff for the road. And we add another layer to the mix with exclusive Harley-Davidson® saddlebag and Tour-Pak® liners. Dual-direction zippers for more access. Side pockets for your quick-reach items like cell phones, keys and toll money. Rubber bottoms that keep the insides dry and clean, and d-rings let you clip on attachments and shoulder straps for easy transport. This is ""limited edition"" without limits.LARGE 17-INCH FRONT WHEELIf you crave long-haul agility on rides of all distances, you're going to love this. We beefed things up by adding a big, mighty wheel with a low aspect ratio. That means the bike maintains its legendary tight turning radius, balanced feel and superior low-speed maneuverability.Enter this link to see more images plus all other inventory we have available: http://lyv.cc/QSQF9Basic Information:Year: 2012Make: Harley-Davidson®Model: TouringTrim: FLHTK - Electra Glide Ultra LimitedStock Number: U10524Condition: UsedType: TouringMileage: 23,686Title: ClearColor: Red / MerlotAccent Color: Red / MerlotBrakes:ABS BrakesBrake Brand Name: BremboFront Brake: Dual Hydraulic DiscFront Brake Diameter (in): 11.5Front Brake Diameter (mm): 292.1Linked Brake System Front to RearRear Brake: Hydraulic DiscRear Brake Diameter (in): 11.5Rear Brake Diameter (mm): 292.1Chassis & Suspension:Air Adjustable Rear SuspensionFrame: SteelFront Adjustable Rebound DampingFront Suspension Type: Telescopic ForkNumber Rear Shock Absorbers: 2Rear Adjustable Rebound DampingRear Adjustable Shock / Spring Pre-LoadRear Suspension Material: SteelRear Suspension Type: Twin Sided Swing ArmComfort:CB RadioCruise ControlDigital InstrumentationHeated Hand Grip Location: DriverIntercomOil Pressure GaugeNumber Of Speakers: 4Trip OdometerRadio Brand Name: Harman/KardonSeat BackrestDrivetrain:Heel Toe ShifterNumber Of Speeds: 6Primary Drive (Rear Wheel): BeltTransmission: ManualPrimary Drive (Engine / Transmission): ChainTransmission Gear Ratio (1): 9.59Transmission Gear Ratio (2): 6.65Transmission Gear Ratio (3): 4.94Transmission Gear Ratio (4): 4Transmission Gear Ratio (5): 3.41Transmission Gear Ratio (6): 2.86Engine:Bore (in): 3.88Bore (mm): 98.5Carburetion Type: Fuel InjectedCompression Ratio: 9.6Cooling System: AirCylinders: 2Engine Brand Name: Twin Cam 103Engine Disp. to Weight (cc): 1.97Engine ImmobilizerEngine Immobilizer Brand: Digitally Encoded Security System (DESS)Engine Size (cc): 1687Engine Size (ci): 103Engine Stroke: 4-StrokeEngine Type: V TwinFuel Capacity (gal): 6Fuel InjectorFuel Requirements: PremiumStarter: ElectricStroke (in): 4.38Stroke (mm): 111.3Torque (Ft Lbs): 100Torque (Nm): 135.6Torque RPM: 3250US Miles Per Gallon (Combined): 42Valve Configuration: OHV - PushrodValves: 4Valves Per Cylinder: 2Other Information:Bag LinersBag Liner Material: VinylChassis ProtectorsChromed WheelsEngine Case GuardExterior CoversExterior GuardsFloor BoardsFront FenderFront Fender RailFront Fender TrimGlove Box / Dash StorageHand GripsHard Side CasesHard Side Case Location: Left and Right SideHard Side Case Number: 2Helmet StorageLockable StorageLower FairingSaddle Bag GuardSide CoverRear FenderRear Fender TrimRear RackRear Rack StorageSide Storage MountSide Case MountStandStand Type: KickTool Bag MountUpper FairingTank DividerTank Divider Material: LeatherWind DeflectorWindshieldWindshield Brand: Lexan®Windshield MountsSafety:HeadlightHeadlight Mounting BarHeadlight Type: HalogenFuel Level WarningRearview MirrorsPassing LampsSpecifications:Dry Weight (kg): 388.7Dry Weight (lbs): 857Front Tire (Full Spec): Dunlop 130/80 R17 65HFront Tire (Inches): 17Front Tire Aspect Ratio: 80Front Tire Width: 130Fuel Capacity (liters): 22Ground Clearance (in): 5.1Ground Clearance (mm): 129.5Length (inches): 98Length (mm): 2504.4Rear Tire (Full Spec): Dunlop 180/65 R16 81HRear Tire (Inches): 16Rear Tire Aspect Ratio: 65Rear Tire Speed Rating: 81HRear Tire Width: 180Seat Height (inches): 27Wet Weight (kg): 408.7Wet Weight (lbs): 901Wheelbase (in): 63.5Wheelbase (mm): 1612.9Wheels Composition: AluminumSpeedometerTachometerHarley-Davidson of Folsom115 Woodmere RoadFolsom, CA 95630Ask for: Sales DepartmentMain: (916) 608-9922A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 31364592 10374562",,,,,,,,,,,

The Harley-Davidson® Breakout® model has a stretched, slammed custom style that's low, long and aggressive. It's driven by a powerful air-cooled Twin Cam 103™ Harley® engine with 6 speed cruise drive transmission that provides more performance power for passing and hill-climbing, and a low cruising RPM for more comfortable cruising. The big, bold Gasser wheels have alternating-position spokes with alternating Vivid Black and machined treatments. The FXSB Softail® Breakout® model's Gasser wheels recall the powerful, muscular wheels of classic 1960s and 1970s dragster bikes. The H-D® FXSB model's Big V-Twin engine has a unique, sharp-looking Vivid Black and Chrome treatment. The massive 240 mm rear tire on the Breakout model is the widest wheel on any Harley® production motorcycle.Features may include:Breakout to the NewDon't just break the mold—forge your own with the latest chapter in Harley-Davidson®'s legacy of freedom. A premium custom cruiser inspired by the classic Gasser drag bikes of the '50s and '60s, the Softail® Breakout® model rolls with modern power, top-of-the-line treatments and lots of low-down menace. Big wheels, big paint, big chrome, all wrapped in a refined style—the Breakout® model is a true attention-grabber with a ride that's been painstakingly engineered for fun whether you're winding mountain roads or cruising the strip. It may be low-profile, but the Breakout® motorcycle always makes a big, bold statement.Low Muscular ProfileWith its big, bold stance, the Breakout® motorcycle makes a powerful impact even standing still. Its pure, clean lines, low-slung profile, stretched stance, big wheels and chopped fenders all shout premium custom, solid power and ""look at me"" attitude, even as its performance makes it your choice who gets to stare and for how long before you disappear.Twin Cam 103™ Engine PowerLive your ride to the power of Twin Cam 103™. The air cooled Twin Cam 103™ Harley-Davidson® engine delivers more stump pulling torque, while its Electronic Sequential Port Fuel Injection jetting gives crisp, lively throttle reaction. It’s a performance punch you’ll appreciate when passing, climbing hills, or just catching eyes as you cruise by—all under that signature Motor Company rumble. And it comes at lower cruising rpm, so you ride more smoothly, with less engine vibration and better highway fuel economy.You may be cruising with swagger, but you know safety counts. This sophisticated, factory-installed ABS gives 'stopping power' a double meaning. Its components are tastefully hidden within the wheel hub, so you'll still turn heads with clean, streamlined design. But more importantly, you get certainty in the saddle knowing your bike's going to behave when you need it.Balanced Suspension & HandlingThe Breakout® model may be a big bold bike with a powerful stretched stance, but it's definitely not just for show. We carefully balanced and damped its suspension to give it a neutral feel—even with those big, wide tires—and engineered it for lightness, for an excellent power-to-weight ratio. The bottom line? A smooth, fun ride whether roaring from stoplight to stoplight or winding along country roads.Enter this link to see more images plus all other inventory we have available: http://lyv.cc/ALLVMBasic Information:Year: 2014Make: Harley-Davidson®Model: SoftailTrim: FXSB - BreakoutStock Number: U24584Condition: UsedType: CruiserMileage: 15,652Title: CleanColor: BlackAccent Color: BlackBrakes:ABS BrakesBrake Brand Name: BremboFront Brake: Hydraulic DiscFront Brake Diameter (in): 11.5Front Brake Diameter (mm): 292.1Rear Brake: Hydraulic DiscRear Brake Diameter (in): 11.5Rear Brake Diameter (mm): 292.1Chassis & Suspension:Air Adjustable Rear SuspensionFrame: SteelFront Suspension Type: Telescopic ForkNumber Rear Shock Absorbers: 2Rear Suspension Material: SteelRear Suspension Type: Twin Sided Swing ArmComfort:Digital InstrumentationTrip OdometerDrivetrain:Heel Toe ShifterNumber Of Speeds: 6Primary Drive (Rear Wheel): BeltTransmission: ManualPrimary Drive (Engine / Transmission): ChainTransmission Gear Ratio (1): 9.311Transmission Gear Ratio (2): 6.454Transmission Gear Ratio (3): 4.793Transmission Gear Ratio (4): 3.882Transmission Gear Ratio (5): 3.307Transmission Gear Ratio (6): 2.79Engine:Bore (in): 3.87Bore (mm): 98.3Carburetion Type: Fuel InjectedCompression Ratio: 9.6Cooling System: AirCylinders: 2Engine Brand Name: Twin Cam 103Engine Disp. to Weight (cc): 2.51Engine Size (cc): 1689Engine Size (ci): 103.1Engine Stroke: 4-StrokeEngine Type: V TwinFuel Capacity (gal): 5Fuel InjectorFuel Requirements: PremiumStarter: ElectricStroke (in): 4.37Stroke (mm): 111Torque (Ft Lbs): 95.2Torque (Nm): 129.1Torque RPM: 3000US Miles Per Gallon (Combined): 42Valve Configuration: OHV - PushrodValves: 4Valves Per Cylinder: 2Other Information:Belt GuardDetachable Passenger SeatExterior CoversExterior GuardsFoot PegsFoot Peg Location: Driver and PassengerFront FenderHand GripsSide CoverRear FenderRear Fender RailStandStand Type: KickTank DividerSafety:HeadlightHeadlight Type: HalogenFuel Level WarningRearview MirrorsSpecifications:Dry Weight (kg): 304.8Dry Weight (lbs): 672Front Tire (Full Spec): Dunlop 130/60 R21 63HFront Tire (Inches): 21Front Tire Aspect Ratio: 60Front Tire Width: 130Fuel Capacity (liters): 18Ground Clearance (in): 4.7Ground Clearance (mm): 119.4Length (inches): 96Length (mm): 2446Rear Tire (Full Spec): Dunlop 240/40 R18 79VRear Tire (Inches): 18Rear Tire Aspect Ratio: 40Rear Tire Speed Rating: 79VRear Tire Width: 240Seat Height (inches): 26Wet Weight (kg): 322.1Wet Weight (lbs): 710Wheelbase (in): 67.3Wheelbase (mm): 1709.4Wheels Composition: AluminumSpeedometerTachometerHarley-Davidson of Folsom115 Woodmere RoadFolsom, CA 95630Ask for: Sales DepartmentMain: (916) 608-9922A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 32780718 10374542",,,,,,,,,,,

Whether riding one, or building a new one from LED headlamp to taillight. Welcome to the top of the line bagger.Features May Include:Project RUSHMORE - ControlHere are some of the innovations Project RUSHMORE led to: the Reflex™ Linked Brakes with ABS, the Daymaker™ LED headlamps and fog lamps, brighter turn signals, brighter brake lights, and a steering head with stiffer front forks. Locked-up tires are now history even when there's wet pavement. We'??ve made it feel even better to lean your way through a turn. Now you can see better. And we'??ve made you more conspicuous to the cage-driving public. Because one thing we all agree on is this: bikes that work better make riders who ride better. Take a ride. See how good you can be.Project RUSHMORE - EngineAs every rider knows, the engine is at the heart of the experience of riding a motorcycle. The amount of torque and horsepower it delivers over the RPM range is in direct proportion to the feeling it gives you when you roll on the throttle. We know what riders want from a motorcycle engine because we've been building them for 110 years. Project RUSHMORE gave us the opportunity to dial it in just right. We conducted thousands of road tests with real riders giving us feedback to build the next iteration of the legendary Harley-Davidson® engine. The consensus was: We want more. More low-end torque, more passing power, more perfection in the tone of the exhaust note, more of the feeling we ride a motorcycle for. And last year, we unveiled the engines that deliver it. This is the next level of Harley-Davidson® V-Twin engine. And it proves, once and for all, the customer is always right.Project RUSHMORE - InfotainmentMore sound. Purer sound. Big, full-color touch screens. Switches that are located where you intuitively want them to be and can reach without removing your hands from the grips. Voice activation for your music, phone and GPS. Or as more than one rider asked: ""Why can'??t the infotainment system on my motorcycle blow away the ones the car companies put in their cars?"" We couldn'??t agree more. Check out the infotainment system Project RUSHMORE brought to the sport of motorcycling. You won'??t believe your eyes. Or ears.Project RUSHMORE - ComfortWe dialed in the comfort of our machines the hard way: over thousands of miles in all kinds of riding conditions on every kind of street, road and highway ever laid down in pavement. Experienced riders and passengers putting in long hours in the saddle and giving us feedback on every aspect that contributes to comfort on the road. Airflow, heat management, passenger space, back rests, seat textures, legroom and hand controls all went under the hard microscope of the road and got tested and re-tested by real riders and worked and re-worked by us until we were satisfied we had built the most comfortable machines on the road. We all want to go farther, and when you and your passenger are more comfortable in the saddle, you can.Enter this link to see more images plus all other inventory we have available: http://lyv.cc/MZV2PBasic Information:Year: 2015Make: Harley-Davidson®Model: FLHTKL - Ultra Limited LowStock Number: U32068VIN: 1HD1KKL39FB632068Condition: UsedType: TouringMileage: 22,655Title: CleanColor: Mysterious Red Sunglo/Blackened Cayenne SungloBrakes:ABS BrakesBrake Brand Name: BremboFront Brake: Dual Hydraulic DiscLinked Brake System Front to RearRear Brake: Hydraulic DiscChassis & Suspension:Air Adjustable Rear SuspensionFrame: SteelFront Adjustable Rebound DampingFront Suspension Size (in): 1.9Front Suspension Size (mm): 49Front Suspension Type: Telescopic ForkNumber Rear Shock Absorbers: 2Rear Adjustable Rebound DampingRear Adjustable Shock / Spring Pre-LoadRear Suspension Material: SteelRear Suspension Type: Twin Sided Swing ArmComfort:Cruise ControlDigital InstrumentationHeated Hand Grip Location: DriverIntercomOil Pressure GaugeNumber Of Speakers: 4Trip ComputerTrip OdometerRadio Brand Name: Boom!™ Box 6.5GTSeat BackrestDrivetrain:Heel Toe ShifterNumber Of Speeds: 6Primary Drive (Rear Wheel): BeltTransmission: ManualPrimary Drive (Engine / Transmission): ChainTransmission Gear Ratio (1): 9.593Transmission Gear Ratio (2): 6.65Transmission Gear Ratio (3): 4.938Transmission Gear Ratio (4): 4Transmission Gear Ratio (5): 3.407Transmission Gear Ratio (6): 2.875Engine:Bore (in): 3.87Bore (mm): 98.3Carburetion Type: Fuel InjectedCompression Ratio: 10.0Cooling System: AirCylinders: 2Engine Brand Name: Twin-Cooled High-Output Twin Cam 103Engine Disp. to Weight (cc): 1.96Engine ImmobilizerEngine Immobilizer Brand: Digitally Encoded Security System (DESS)Engine Size (cc): 1689Engine Size (ci): 103.1Engine Stroke: 4-StrokeEngine Type: V TwinFuel Capacity (gal): 6Fuel InjectorFuel Requirements: PremiumStarter: ElectricStroke (in): 4.37Stroke (mm): 111Torque (Ft Lbs): 105.5Torque (Nm): 143Torque RPM: 3750US Miles Per Gallon (Combined): 42Valve Configuration: OHV - PushrodValves: 4Valves Per Cylinder: 2Other Information:Bag LinersBag Liner Material: VinylChassis ProtectorsChromed WheelsEngine Case GuardExterior CoversExterior GuardsFloor BoardsFront FenderFront Fender TrimGlove Box / Dash StorageHand GripsHard Side CasesHard Side Case Location: Left and Right SideHard Side Case Number: 2Helmet StorageLockable StorageLower FairingSaddle Bag GuardMap HolderSide CoverRear FenderRear Fender TrimRear RackRear Rack StorageSide Storage MountSide Case MountStandStand Type: KickTool Bag MountUpper FairingTank DividerTank Divider Material: LeatherWind DeflectorWindshieldWindshield Brand: Lexan®Windshield MountsSafety:HeadlightHeadlight Mounting BarHeadlight Type: HalogenFuel Level WarningRearview MirrorsPassing LampsSpecifications:Dry Weight (kg): 390.5Dry Weight (lbs): 861Front Tire (Full Spec): Dunlop Multi-Tread 130/80 R17 65HFront Tire (Inches): 17Front Tire Aspect Ratio: 80Front Tire Width: 130Fuel Capacity (liters): 22Ground Clearance (in): 4.6Ground Clearance (mm): 116.8Length (inches): 102Length (mm): 2601Rear Tire (Full Spec): Dunlop Multi-Tread 180/65 R16 81HRear Tire (Inches): 16Rear Tire Aspect Ratio: 65Rear Tire Speed Rating: 81HRear Tire Width: 180Seat Height (inches): 27Storage Capacity (cuft): 4.7Wet Weight (kg): 406.4Wet Weight (lbs): 896Wheelbase (in): 64Wheelbase (mm): 1625.6Wheels Composition: AluminumSpeedometerTachometerHarley-Davidson of Rocklin4401 Granite DriveRocklin, CA 95630Ask for: Sales DepartmentMain: (916) 259-2453A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 33300435 10374567",,,,,,,,,,,

It's equally at home hauling loose brush loads or heavy equipment. Based on an 8"" I-beam frame, the DJX includes heavy-duty features like an industry-leading 6"" scissor hoist. We house the KTI hydraulic pump and Interstate battery in a unique full-width, internally split toolbox. This protects the heart of the hydraulics system and provides a convenient place for chains and other important tools. You can also choose to outfit the DJX with 2', 3' or 4' tall Tuff Sides. These sides provide a massive 3"" top cap surface that wraps partially down the side of the trailer. These top rails are then supported with flared steel side supports. Combined, they help form a bed that's extremely resistant to warping, dents, and damage. All of our dumps come equipped with tarp-kits as a standard feature. We build each DJX with a standard GVWR of 14,000 lbs and twin 7K Dexter electric brake axles. You can configure these versatile dumps in lengths of 12', 14, and 16 with base weights ranging from 4,150 lbs to 4,550 lbs. Like all MAXX-D Trailers, the DJX I-beam dump model is finished with our industry-leading powder coating process. Six different steps all work together to give your trailer a premium powder-coated steel surface with unmatched durability. Through our expansive dealer network, we give you the option to configure your DJX low profile dump trailer with a variety of options to fit your needs. Whether it's an extra set of D-rings, solar battery charger, or your choice of side height and configuration, you can get a DJX that's perfect for whatever it is you're building. With both gooseneck and bumper pull styles available, the DJX is an ideal choice for construction, roofing, agriculture, landscaping, and any other large projects you can dream of.

It's equally at home hauling loose brush loads or heavy equipment. Based on an 8"" I-beam frame, the DJX includes heavy-duty features like an industry-leading 6"" scissor hoist. We house the KTI hydraulic pump and Interstate battery in a unique full-width, internally split toolbox. This protects the heart of the hydraulics system and provides a convenient place for chains and other important tools. You can also choose to outfit the DJX with 2', 3' or 4' tall Tuff Sides. These sides provide a massive 3"" top cap surface that wraps partially down the side of the trailer. These top rails are then supported with flared steel side supports. Combined, they help form a bed that's extremely resistant to warping, dents, and damage. All of our dumps come equipped with tarp-kits as a standard feature. We build each DJX with a standard GVWR of 14,000 lbs and twin 7K Dexter electric brake axles. You can configure these versatile dumps in lengths of 12', 14, and 16 with base weights ranging from 4,150 lbs to 4,550 lbs. Like all MAXX-D Trailers, the DJX I-beam dump model is finished with our industry-leading powder coating process. Six different steps all work together to give your trailer a premium powder-coated steel surface with unmatched durability. Through our expansive dealer network, we give you the option to configure your DJX low profile dump trailer with a variety of options to fit your needs. Whether it's an extra set of D-rings, solar battery charger, or your choice of side height and configuration, you can get a DJX that's perfect for whatever it is you're building. With both gooseneck and bumper pull styles available, the DJX is an ideal choice for construction, roofing, agriculture, landscaping, and any other large projects you can dream of.

It's equally at home hauling loose brush loads or heavy equipment. Based on an 8"" I-beam frame, the DJX includes heavy-duty features like an industry-leading 6"" scissor hoist. We house the KTI hydraulic pump and Interstate battery in a unique full-width, internally split toolbox. This protects the heart of the hydraulics system and provides a convenient place for chains and other important tools. You can also choose to outfit the DJX with 2', 3' or 4' tall Tuff Sides. These sides provide a massive 3"" top cap surface that wraps partially down the side of the trailer. These top rails are then supported with flared steel side supports. Combined, they help form a bed that's extremely resistant to warping, dents, and damage. All of our dumps come equipped with tarp-kits as a standard feature. We build each DJX with a standard GVWR of 14,000 lbs and twin 7K Dexter electric brake axles. You can configure these versatile dumps in lengths of 12', 14, and 16 with base weights ranging from 4,150 lbs to 4,550 lbs. Like all MAXX-D Trailers, the DJX I-beam dump model is finished with our industry-leading powder coating process. Six different steps all work together to give your trailer a premium powder-coated steel surface with unmatched durability. Through our expansive dealer network, we give you the option to configure your DJX low profile dump trailer with a variety of options to fit your needs. Whether it's an extra set of D-rings, solar battery charger, or your choice of side height and configuration, you can get a DJX that's perfect for whatever it is you're building. With both gooseneck and bumper pull styles available, the DJX is an ideal choice for construction, roofing, agriculture, landscaping, and any other large projects you can dream of.

We are in need of a regular car something more practical so it is sad for us to let it go, as the passenger it’s so comfortable and delightful to ride along with him. It’s a super fun bike and definitely has a lot of life left. With gas prices how they are now it would be great. 25$ almost filled it up so that’s a huge plus!

Take a look at more of the Harley-Davidson® touring motorcycles including the motorcycle luggage storage capacity of the Electra Glide® Classic model or the Road Glide® Ultra model ideal for motorcycle travel.Classic Fuel TankPart of the unmistakable style of the Harley-Davidson® Street Glide® motorcycle is plenty of room for showing off your paint. This classically styled, bold six-gallon fuel tank doesn't just give you a bigger canvas for premium or custom paint; it holds six gallons of go so you can eat up a lot more road between pit stops. We know fuel economy is important—but so is style. Sharp, eye-catching colors and precision-crafted Harley-Davidson® tank medallions complete the unique look of this tough bagger.Twin Cam 103™ Engine HeritageThe knowledge of what makes an engine truly move a rider runs deep at The Motor Company, and it was put to good use when we created the Twin Cam 103™ engine. We painstakingly perfected every cubic inch, pushing design and technology forward—all without compromising one bit of Harley-Davidson®'s unique styling. Evolved, yet carrying on the legacy of the Flathead, Knucklehead, Panhead, Shovelhead, Evolution®, Twin Cam 88® and Twin Cam 96™ engines that came before. The performance and durability are a direct result of the untold miles logged on the V-Twin since 1909, and the proud heritage that comes from a century's worth of commitment to life on two wheels.Harman/Kardon® Advanced Audio SystemNaturally, the king of the road gets some royal extras. The premium two-speaker, 20-watt per channel Harman/Kardon® audio system boasts great sound for booming down the boulevard and highway, and, yeah, it might as well go to 11. It's loud, proud and comes with AM/FM receiver and accommodates a CD or MP3 player. Riding free just wouldn't be the same without the right soundtrack.Dunlop® Multi-Tread™ TiresThe 180mm back tire is engineered to do more than fill out the rear fender and put a bigger patch of rubber on the road. Dunlop® Multi-Tread™ technology uses harder compounds at the center and softer on the sides for a tire that still knows how to knuckle-down on corners. Perfect for making this bike agile on every curvy stretch of road. And the way it feels going through an abrupt off-camber turn will put a grin on your face that'll last to the next state line.Two-Up SeatingModern styling and comfort that doesn't sacrifice an ounce of nostalgic style: This ultimate Touring saddle features a sculpted seat with a deeper contoured bucket and narrower neck, to relieve pressure on your thighs, while providing more back support and comfort for a wide variety of rider sizes. And the lower seat height—26.1 inches to be exact—puts your feet closer to the road to enhance your confidence. Additionally, the leather trim and premium stitching accentuate the advanced ergonomics while giving the seat that sharp detail you only find on a Harley-Davidson® motorcycle. It's science in service of comfort, and your way to beat fatigue over the long haul.Enter this link to see more images plus all other inventory we have available: http://lyv.cc/K4S89Basic Information:Year: 2013Make: Harley-Davidson®Model: FLHX - Street GlideStock Number: C40984Condition: UsedType: TouringMileage: 4852Title: CleanColor: Midnight PearlAccent Color: Midnight PearlBrakes:Brake Brand Name: BremboFront Brake: Dual Hydraulic DiscFront Brake Diameter (in): 11.5Front Brake Diameter (mm): 292.1Rear Brake: Hydraulic DiscRear Brake Diameter (in): 11.5Rear Brake Diameter (mm): 292.1Chassis & Suspension:Air Adjustable Rear SuspensionFrame: SteelFront Suspension Type: Telescopic ForkNumber Rear Shock Absorbers: 2Rear Adjustable Rebound DampingRear Adjustable Shock / Spring Pre-LoadRear Suspension Material: SteelRear Suspension Type: Twin Sided Swing ArmComfort:Digital InstrumentationOil Pressure GaugeNumber Of Speakers: 2Trip OdometerRadio Brand Name: Harman/KardonDrivetrain:Heel Toe ShifterNumber Of Speeds: 6Primary Drive (Rear Wheel): BeltTransmission: ManualPrimary Drive (Engine / Transmission): ChainTransmission Gear Ratio (1): 9.59Transmission Gear Ratio (2): 6.65Transmission Gear Ratio (3): 4.94Transmission Gear Ratio (4): 4Transmission Gear Ratio (5): 3.41Transmission Gear Ratio (6): 2.88Engine:Bore (in): 3.88Bore (mm): 98.6Carburetion Type: Fuel InjectedCompression Ratio: 9.6Cooling System: AirCylinders: 2Engine Brand Name: Twin Cam 103Engine Disp. to Weight (cc): 2.16Engine Size (cc): 1687Engine Size (ci): 103Engine Stroke: 4-StrokeEngine Type: V TwinFuel Capacity (gal): 6Fuel InjectorFuel Requirements: PremiumStarter: ElectricStroke (in): 4.38Stroke (mm): 111.3Torque (Ft Lbs): 100Torque (Nm): 135.6Torque RPM: 3250US Miles Per Gallon (Combined): 42Valve Configuration: OHV - PushrodValves: 4Valves Per Cylinder: 2Other Information:Chassis ProtectorsEngine Case GuardExterior CoversExterior GuardsFloor BoardsFoot PegsFoot Peg Location: PassengerFork GuardsHand GuardsFront FenderHand GripsHard Side CasesHard Side Case Location: Left and Right SideHard Side Case Number: 2Helmet StorageLockable StorageSide CoverRear FenderSide Storage MountSide Case MountStandStand Type: KickUpper FairingTank DividerWindshieldWindshield Brand: Lexan®Windshield MountsSafety:HeadlightHeadlight Type: HalogenFuel Level WarningRearview MirrorsSpecifications:Dry Weight (kg): 355.2Dry Weight (lbs): 783Front Tire (Full Spec): Dunlop Multi-Tread 130/70 R18 63HFront Tire (Inches): 18Front Tire Aspect Ratio: 70Front Tire Width: 130Fuel Capacity (liters): 22Ground Clearance (in): 4.7Ground Clearance (mm): 119.4Length (inches): 95Length (mm): 2413Rear Tire (Full Spec): Dunlop Multi-Tread 180/65 R16 81HRear Tire (Inches): 16Rear Tire Aspect Ratio: 65Rear Tire Speed Rating: 81HRear Tire Width: 180Seat Height (inches): 27Wet Weight (kg): 367.9Wet Weight (lbs): 811Wheelbase (in): 63.5Wheelbase (mm): 1612.9Wheels Composition: AluminumSpeedometerTachometerHarley-Davidson of Folsom115 Woodmere RoadFolsom, CA 95630Ask for: Sales DepartmentMain: (916) 608-9922A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 32704798 10374546",,,,,,,,,,,

With its twin headlamps, iconic style and unique attitude, it's absolutely distinct on the streets, while its integrated storage gives you a resting place for valuables you need to access easily during your journey. The headlamp shroud and windscreen trim add style to the fairing without straying from its legendary look.GTX® SADDLEBAGSThese injection-molded hard bags have room for 2.26 cu. ft. volume of long-haul luxuries and a perfect surface for showing off some premium paint.

At the very top of the mountain in terms of power, features and riding experience, this is the motorcycle you'll find.The 2014 Harley-Davidson® CVO™ Limited model is a high-end performance motorcycle with Twin Cam 110™ power that gives you the ultimate in premium featured touring. As part of Project RushMore for 2014, the CVO™ Limited has been redesigned from the ground up for more comfort, more power, better braking and handling and more classic style. The iconic batwing H-D® fairing has been totally redesigned to reduce head buffeting. This bike is powered by a new Harley® High Output Twin Cam 110™ Engine with Screamin’ Eagle badges. The new high-output Twin Cam 110™ engine with Screamin' Eagle badges provides 110 cubic inches of power, a low cruising rpm, more low end torque, more passing power, along with silky smooth shifting of its 6-speed cruise drive transmission. The H-D® CVO™ Limited motorcycle features the new Reflex™ anti-lock braking system (ABS) with dynamically, electronically linked brakes for optimum braking in all conditions. This big V-Twin Cam 110™ performance motorcycle is custom touring at its finest. We've added more room for the passenger. For an ultra comfortable ride the seat is heated. Take a good look at all of the premium features and components of this bike, including the Harley-Davidson® Twin Cam 110™ engine with Screamin' Eagle badges and upgraded Boom!™ Box 6.5 infotainment system with it's 6.5"" full color screen.Features May Include:Project RUSHMORE - EngineAs every rider knows, the engine is at the heart of the experience of riding a motorcycle. The amount of torque and horsepower it delivers over the RPM range is in direct proportion to the feeling it gives you when you roll on the throttle. We know what riders want from a motorcycle engine because we’ve been building them for 110 years. Project RUSHMORE gave us the opportunity to dial it in just right. We conducted thousands of road tests with real riders giving us feedback to build the next iteration of the legendary Harley-Davidson® engine.New Boom!™ Box 6.5GT RadioLet’s start with the big news: 25% more volume for your tunes. The new Boom!™ Box 6.5GT Radio puts out 75 watts per channel at 1% distortion and features a factory-tuned, optimized equalizer that pumps out more power and can be played louder while maintaining the clarity of your sound. And the new speed tuning system delivers more than just volume changes at different speeds. It changes the level of bass and treble to dial-in the best sound, whether you’re running at stately pace down the strip or going hell for leather down an open stretch of road.Project RUSHMORE - ConfidenceHere are some of the innovations The Rider Project led to: the new Reflex™ Linked Brakes with Anti-lock Braking System. New dual halogen and LED headlamps and fog lamps, brighter Tour-Pak® lighting, brighter turn signals, brighter brake lights, and a new steering head with stiffer front forks. Locked-up tires are now history even when there’s wet pavement. We’ve made it feel even better to lean your way through a turn. Now you can see better.Project RUSHMORE - ComfortWe dialed in the comfort of our machines the hard way: over thousands of miles in all kinds of riding conditions on every kind of street, road and highway ever laid down in pavement. Experienced riders and passengers putting in long hours in the saddle and giving us feedback on every aspect that contributes to comfort on the road.Enter this link to see more images plus all other inventory we have available: http://lyv.cc/2U73YBasic Information:Year: 2014Make: Harley-Davidson®Model: FLHTKSE - CVO LimitedStock Number: U50385VIN: 1HD1TEN1XEB950385Condition: UsedType: TouringMileage: 14,690Title: CleanColor: Burgandy Blaze/Typhoon MaroonBrakes:ABS BrakesBrake Brand Name: BremboFront Brake: Dual Hydraulic DiscLinked Brake System Front to RearRear Brake: Hydraulic DiscChassis & Suspension:Air Adjustable Rear SuspensionFrame: SteelFront Suspension Size (in): 1.9Front Suspension Size (mm): 49Front Suspension Type: Telescopic ForkNumber Rear Shock Absorbers: 2Rear Adjustable Rebound DampingRear Adjustable Shock / Spring Pre-LoadRear Suspension Material: SteelRear Suspension Type: Twin Sided Swing ArmComfort:Cruise ControlDigital InstrumentationTrip ComputerTrip OdometerSeat BackrestDrivetrain:Heel Toe ShifterNumber Of Speeds: 6Primary Drive (Rear Wheel): BeltTransmission: ManualPrimary Drive (Engine / Transmission): ChainTransmission Gear Ratio (2): 6.65Transmission Gear Ratio (4): 4Engine:Bore (in): 4Bore (mm): 101.6Carburetion Type: Fuel InjectedCompression Ratio: 9.2Cooling System: AirCylinders: 2Engine Brand Name: Twin Cam 110Engine ImmobilizerEngine Immobilizer Brand: Digitally Encoded Security System (DESS)Engine Size (cc): 1801Engine Size (ci): 109.9Engine Stroke: 4-StrokeEngine Type: V TwinFuel Capacity (gal): 6Fuel InjectorFuel Requirements: PremiumStarter: ElectricStroke (in): 4.37Stroke (mm): 111Torque RPM: 3750US Miles Per Gallon (Combined): 41Valve Configuration: OHV - PushrodValves: 4Valves Per Cylinder: 2Other Information:Chassis ProtectorsChromed WheelsEngine Case GuardExterior CoversExterior GuardsFloor BoardsFront FenderHand GripsHard Side CasesHard Side Case Location: Left and Right SideHard Side Case Number: 2Helmet StorageLockable StorageSaddle Bag GuardSide CoverRear FenderSide Storage MountSide Case MountStandStand Type: KickTank DividerWindshieldWindshield Brand: Lexan®Windshield MountsSafety:HeadlightHeadlight Type: HalogenFuel Level WarningRearview MirrorsSpecifications:Front Tire Width: 130Fuel Capacity (liters): 22Ground Clearance (in): 5.3Ground Clearance (mm): 134.6Rear Tire Width: 180Wheelbase (in): 64Wheelbase (mm): 1625.6Wheels Composition: AluminumSpeedometerTachometerHarley-Davidson of Rocklin4401 Granite DriveRocklin, CA 95630Ask for: Sales DepartmentMain: (916) 259-2453A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 33091424 10374579",,,,,,,,,,,

Loaded - WAS $3,890 w/o Tax & Accessories",,,,,13,"This electric bike was purchased to have fun driving around with my German Shepherd, rather than use our $1,000,000 SUV everyday.    I paid $3,890.00 WITHOUT TAX, SHIPPING PLUS I ADDED ANOTHER $1,000.00 MORE IN ACCESSORIES.  NOT including 40 hours of custom engineering to sidecar and couple of modifications.  As former military Jet Engine Mechanic and Engineer, I love inventing, crafting/building things, as you can see in my million-dollar SUV.    I bought this electric bike in Austin, TX and had it shipped here to west Reno at Somersett.  The old folks on the wide sidewalks here in the retirement community of Somersett, snicker when I ask them to move over to let us by.  It has red and blue police strobe lights and electric horn but they're old and cranky and they don't care, so now we're tired of them and it's for sale... plus I want more room in my garage as you'd see how full it is when you come to see and test drive the bike.   It may sound stupid or obvious, but the $1,000,000 SUV in the photographic section below, is NOT included in the $3,400 bicycle cost advertised herein.   The sidecar removes in seconds using the three genuine fighter jet safety quick pins, and the bike will ride 50 miles at 36 mph on one charge that takes about two hours from 0-full charge.  The digital dash keeps you informed in so many ways. I have the owner manual for your reference on the digital dash and reading.  You can use it normal or you can program it.  You don't have to program it, only if you want.     We only rode it for 4 trips around the neighborhood, and even up the long steep hills it is fast.  So maybe 3.5 hours total usage time... YES it's THAT new.   I bought an extra battery charger, 3 extra fat tubes and 2 extra fat tires, extra disc brake pads and it ALL COMES WITH THIS BIKE at NO EXTRA CHARGE... and the brakes are HYDRAULIC ACTIVATED ...no cables to get old or dirty and friction-y, etc.  The brakes and brake lever/handles are SO VERY, VERY EASY AND SMOOTH ACTION.  Even the rear brake light lights-up when you depress either left or right / front or rear brake handle.   The handle grips are genuine hand-sewn leather, and the seat has not only a shock absorber post but two springs under the fat comfortable seat.  I paid an extra $300 for the heavy duty rack behind the seat as you can see in the photographs.   You also get a composite-fiber water bottle holder (mounted already), a yellow LED factory headlight with off/on dash controls, as seen in photos, and an LED aux headlight on handlebars, and a gentle bike ""ting"" sound device when approaching people, or just use the included electric horn you can program or use as is with a high-pitch chirp... it has the best pedals too IF you want to use the pedals or in assist with electric motor or just electric only.   The sidecar and cage is built custom for my 100 lb German Shepherd, complete with nylon braided restraints and awesome carabiners, waterproof padding, seat cushions, and rear padded guard(s) to keep him from falling out the back if not harnessed-in.  I spent hundreds of dollars on aluminum and padding and numerous very expensive stainless steel quick release aircraft pins ($55 each), NOT including my 50-60 hours of labor in building the sidecar.   You can take a dog, child or groceries in the sidecar, and with gas at $5 gallon and not ending soon, likely getting higher forever, this bike has many uses and it's entertaining to ride/drive, too.   The ""2"" leather side pouches hold hats, gloves or whatever you want.  Top pouch behind seat holds the best tire change tools and tire repair kits and spare new tube, air pump, etc. that COMES WITH IT AS WELL.  The front leather storage pouch in middle of handle bars holds cell phone, keys, etc.   I never planned to sell this so I invested over $5,000 NOT including my tens of thousands of dollars in labor.   It is so fast with me at 155 lbs and 100 lb dog, so imagine the speed without sidecar and dog... but so much fun with someone enjoying next to you.  You can have my $300 aluminum seat (free) to mount in/on the sidecar if you want to take a spouse or friend or they can sit on the floor pads which are on it now or whatever seat you have at home that you like better.

From weekend roads to everyday roads, from city streets to twisting country highways. With a comfortable riding position, a dry weight of just 184 kg and the impressive performance of the Testastretta 11° engine, every ride becomes an opportunity to indulge your sporting instinct. Wherever, whenever, the SuperSport makes every motorcyclist a real rider: whichever road you take, get ready to experience it as never before.DesignThe Ducati Design Center has come up with a dynamic, polished, visually compact, light machine that is Ducati to the core.A front-on look shows it has a distinct 'family feel' with the Panigale superbike. In addition to the highly distinctive LED Daytime Running Light (DRL), the headlight's low and high beam parabolas are positioned in the shadows of the assembly, almost hiding them from direct frontal view: just like those mounted on the top Ducati sports models.Low-set, streamlined and assertive, the SuperSport nose fairing flows naturally into the steel fuel tank structure, carrying the colour scheme all the way into the well-designed cockpit that houses the LCD instrument panel. A sports-style Plexiglas screen with two different height settings ensures aerodynamically efficient airflow protection.Seen side-on, the lines, proportions and volumes are typical of Ducati sports bikes, with the streamlined tail and sculpted tank playing a pivotal role. The latter is coupled to both the main and nose fairings by beefy buttresses that enclose the Trellis frame. Cut to reveal exhaust manifold and engine, the lower fairing is designed to be easy on the eye, a must on a Ducati SuperSport.Ducati's conscientious attention to technical components is also seen in the compact, sports-style stacked dual-pipe side muffler. Shaping and low-slung design bring out the dynamism of the tail, leaving the rear wheel Y-spokes in clear view and providing plenty of room for side panniers (available as accessories).Testastretta 11°The SuperSport is powered by a specially adapted version of the already renowned and appreciated 937 cm3 twin-cylinder Ducati Testastretta 11°. Euro 4-rated, it has four valves per cylinder, a secondary air system, liquid cooling, a 12.6:1 compression ratio and bore and stroke measurements of 94 and 67.5 mm respectively. Engine output amounts to a huge 113 hp at 9, 000 rpm and a maximum torque of 96.7 Nm at 6,500 rpm.On the SuperSport, the Testastretta 11° engine features crankcase and cylinder heads that have been redesigned to make the power unit an integral part of the frame; further modifications include re-routing of the water through the heads and a specifically designed alternator cover to allow installation of the new gear sensor. Large 53 mm throttle bodies - smoothly controlled by the full Ride-by-Wire system - allow the engine to gulp in the air-fuel mix. Moreover, this engine also features unprecedented control and injection systems.

We've kept all the modern comforts where they belong—below the surface of a rad, vintage-looking bike. You get the classic lines of a vintage ""hardtail"" frame with the horizontal rear shocks hidden in the guts. It's a signature rigid look, and you'll only find it on a Softail® model.Nostalgic Custom StyleDo laced wheels, whitewalls and studded leather add to the way a bike feels on the road? Of course they do. It's these extras that make the Heritage Softail® Classic model the quintessential boulevard cruiser. As rallies were gaining grassroots traction in the '40s, you'd roll into Daytona Bike Week expecting new stories and new styles. There was really something going on, and it's still alive and well in this bike. Take the saddlebags, studded with style straight from that golden era, with hidden quick-detach buckles. Or the fenders—full and fluid, with chrome highlights and matching paint. Or that big, commanding 7-inch ball headlamp, chromed and classy. And let's talk wheels. You can go with the standard steel-laced wheels on blackwalls with a chrome hub. Or turn the clock all the way back with the optional chrome laces and wide whitewalls.Old-School Tank and 3-D MedallionThe unique medallion on the Heritage Softail® Classic motorcycle is glass-inlayed, cloisonné-and-chrome style and shows that Harley-Davidson® Softail® model heritage that runs in your blood. With a five-gallon capacity for long weekend cruising, we top off this tank with a nostalgic chrome ""cats-eye"" console, paint for days and style to spare.Tank-Mounted ConsoleThe speedometer face boasts a big, bold display for the odometer, along with an ancillary display for gear and rpm, offering up the information you need on the fly.Tombstone TaillightA vintage classic. The chrome, low profile taillight housing lays back against the fender but shines with Harley-Davidson history. Flanked by our sleek silver bullet turn signals, that glowing red gravestone is the last thing they'll see as you pull away into the night.Whitewall TiresOne of the defining styling features of the Softail® Deluxe model is the nostalgic wide whitewall tires with premium laced wheels. A nod to the ‘50s boulevard look, these fat rubber rollers are just the right throwback detail from Harley-Davidson that ups the ante in any scene. Total old-school styling without sacrificing handling or performance.Hard Candy Custom™ PaintHard Candy Custom™ is a large metal flake finish that’s more than just paint job, it’s a shining declaration of independence—bright, bold and unique. The Softail Deluxe is available in Hard Candy Cancun Blue Flake. Recalling the iconic rebel styling of ‘70s custom bikes, Hard Candy Custom marks another milestone in The Motor Company’s legacy of innovation. We start with several passes of 200 micron flake over a silver base, then clear coat it, hand-lay and mask the pattern and apply the Candy color to allow the flake to shine through.

Maybe it’s your brother-in-law, or your neighbor, or some guy at your workplace. He’s always telling you what he’s going to do . . . but he never really does anything.But there’s another kind of guy too—someone who turns every day into something that’s fun. Every weekend he comes back with a story to tell, even if he never crossed a state line.Honda®’s new VFR®1200X is built for people who know adventure isn’t someplace you go, it’s what you do getting there. It’s an excellent machine for exploring the world around you, and doing it in comfort, confidence, and style. Sporty, athletic, nimble enough for around-town cruising or tight winding back roads, it’s also big enough to reel in those highway miles, and see the Statue of Liberty, Mount Rushmore, and the Alamo all in the same trip.And the new VFR®1200X is loaded with features too—the most important being its 1237cc V4 engine and choice of six-speed transmissions. Best of all, we’re offering a ton of accessories, so you can fine-tune it to how you want to ride.Where will a new 2016 Honda® VFR®1200X take you? Wherever adventure calls.Features May Include:1237cc V4 EngineDrawing on 30 years of V4 technology and racing success, Honda® designers gave the VFR®1200X what is one of our most advanced streetbike engines yet: a fuel-injected, liquid-cooled 1237cc, 76-degree V-4 brimming with low-end torque.Transmission ChoicesYou can choose between a conventional six-speed manual transmission or our latest, third-generation Honda® Automatic DCT transmission. With the DCT, you upshift or downshift with a pair of paddle-style buttons, or you can let the gearbox shift for itself.43mm Inverted ForkWho knows where you’ll be riding, but the VFR®1200X’s suspension is up to the job. The 43mm KYB fork is adjustable for spring preload as well as rebound damping, and is plenty stiff for steering precision.Pro-Link Rear SuspensionThe KYB shock on the VFR®1200X’s rear suspension is adjustable for rebound damping and features a convenient no-tool preload adjuster making it easy to fine-tune the ride for varying loads.Single-Sided SwingarmThe final-drive assembly runs right through the single-sided aluminum swingarm housing, making rear-wheel removal a snap.Dual Front DiscsThe twin front brakes use huge 310mm discs for plenty of fade-free stopping power. Combined ABS is a standard feature.Aluminum FrameThe VFR®1200X’s twin-spar aluminum frame members are fine-tuned to offer very precise control over weight and rigidity, and form the foundation of the bike’s stellar handling.Selectable Torque ControlHonda®'s Selectable Torque Control system (HSTC) is designed to help riders adapt to multiple traction conditions. With the push of a button the VFR®1200X's (HSTC) lets you choose from three levels of engine-torque The system can also be turned off according to rider preference. Available on both manual-transmission and Automatic DCT versions of the VFR®1200X.One-Hand Adjustable WindscreenIt couldn’t be easier to adjust the new VFR®1200X’s windscreen. One hand and a couple of seconds is all you’ll need.
