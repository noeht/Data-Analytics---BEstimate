It had been sitting for a few years and I did some basic maintenance to get it going again. That maintenance included: fresh gas, new battery, topping off the brake fluid, and an oil change.  The bike currently has 20, 550 miles on it and they will slowly go up since I ride the bike around town and to work a few times a week.  The tires are old but still ride fine and it needs new grips.  There are some scratches on the right hand side fairing where the previous owner dropped the bike in his driveway but none of the mounting points are broken or cracked.  This bike is extremely heavy and really thrives at highway speeds.  I am 6 feet 3 inches tall and I weigh 240 pounds and I would say I fit this bike well.  It has a 6 speed transmission, heated grips, adjustable seat, locking detachable saddle bags, ABS, and cruise control.  The bike will also come with 2 keys and a tank bag.  I have put over 500 miles on this bike since I picked it up late last year and I really enjoy riding it however I prefer sport bikes and I am currently trying to downsize my current collection of vehicles.  All this bike really needs is some fresh rubber (tires & grips) and it could easily be rode across the country.  Asking $4200 OBO.  Cash Only.  Please don't waste my time.  Clean Alabama title in my name that I will sign over to you as soon as I have the full amount in cash in my hand.  No test rides unless I am holding full amount in cash in my hand.  Thanks for looking!  Cheers",,

Rebuilt from the road up. Refined inside and out. Ready for anything. There’s a new engine. New front suspension. Available 7-speed DCT. All in a more agile body that’s over 85 pounds lighter. You’ll also find the latest in technology, including Apple CarPlayTM integration, and five distinct trim levels to suit your style. The 2018 Gold Wing is designed to push the limits of what a touring bike can be. And expand the adventure beyond anything imagined.Features may include:PERFORMANCEENGINEThe Gold Wing’s horizontally opposed six-cylinder engine is famously smooth and powerful. We’ve kept that same overall architecture, but it’s an all-new 1833cc powerplant for 2018, and over 13 pounds lighter (more than 8 pounds for the DCT versions).ALUMINUM CYLINDERS SLEEVESHigh-strength aluminum cylinder sleeves help reduce weight, increase cooling efficiency, and reduce engine length. The 73mm cylinder bore and short, high-strength crankshaft also help make the engine more compact.UNICAM CYLINDER HEAD DESIGNThe new engine uses four-valve, Unicam® cylinder head design. That improves engine performance and power, and also contributes to the engine’s weight reduction. The four-valve per cylinder design is also a big part of the new Gold Wing’s improved fuel efficiency.6-SPEED MANUAL TRANSMISSIONWant a manual transmission? The new Gold Wing offers the best conventional gearbox in Gold Wing history. Case in point: now you get an overdrive sixth gear.HANDLINGDOUBLE WISHBONE FRONT SUSPENSIONOne look and your eyes will immediately go to the Gold Wing’s radical, new Honda-engineered double-wishbone front suspension. The innovative design changes the path the wheel travels through the suspension stroke, and that lets us move both the engine and the rider/passenger closer to the front wheel. You get more room, and stellar handling.FRAMEThis latest generation all-aluminum frame is significantly lighter and more compact than previous editions. State-of-the-art die-casting lets us fine-tune chassis rigidity, giving you both a smooth ride and precise handling.SWING ARM/REAR SUSPENSIONUsing our proprietary single-sided Pro Arm® design, the aluminum swingarm still houses the Gold Wing’s shaft drive. The swingarm links to the frame using a new, patented pivot structure that both increases stiffness and reduces weight. You get responsive handling and a smoother ride.ANTI-LOCK BRAKESHave to make a hard stop, fully loaded and two up? All new 2018 Gold Wings are equipped with combined anti-lock brakes for excellent stopping power under a wide variety of road and traction conditions.ENGINEERINGTHROTTLE BY WIREThe 2018 Gold Wing’s throttle-by-wire system affords a degree of engine control you’ve likely never before experienced. It also enables features like our power delivery modes and our exclusive Honda Selectable Torque Control (HSTC) which you’ll find on our Gold Wing Tour models.Year: 2018Make: HondaModel: Gold Wing Tour Automatic DCT Pearl WhiteCondition: UsedTrimStock: P21064Condition: UsedVIN: JH2SC7950JK001198To see similar inventory copy and past this link into your browser.www.southernhonda.comSouthern Honda Powersports5330 Ringgold RoadEast Ridge, TN 37412Ask for: SalesSales: (800) 959-5432A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 33701271 10386653Honda Gold Wing Tour Automatic DCT Pearl White  Honda Gold Wing Tour Automatic DCT Pearl White",,

But somehow, they just keep getting better and better. And that’s exactly what you’ll see with Honda’s Gold Wing. Sure, it’s the bike that started the modern touring revolution way back in 1975. But with every generation, it’s more comfortable, better handling, smoother. A technology leader since day one, today’s Gold Wing offers features like a 7-speed DCT automatic transmission and Apple CarPlayTM. And for 2020, we’re happy to announce that fog lights are now standard equipment on all Gold Wing Tour models.Features may include:PERFORMANCEEngineThe Gold Wing’s horizontally opposed six-cylinder engine is famously smooth and powerful. The latest version is an 1833cc design that’s over 13 pounds lighter than the previous generation (more than 8 pounds for the DCT versions).Aluminum Cylinder SleevesHigh-strength aluminum cylinder sleeves help reduce weight, increase cooling efficiency, and reduce engine length.

This feature momentarily holds your motorcycle’s position on inclines after you’ve released the brakes and before you apply the throttle, eliminating any roll-back drama. It’s a great convenience when starting from a stop on a hill.ELECTRONICSHomeLinkAvailable as an optional feature, HomeLink® lets you integrate your new Gold Wing with devices in your home. A typical example: you can open your home’s garage door without any dedicated controller—just touch a switch on your bike’s center console. No more fumbling, and no hassle.Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)Correct tire inflation is a necessity for safe, economical motorcycling. And it’s especially critical with a touring bike, because of the varying loads. The Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) automatically warns you of low tire pressure on all Gold Wing models. On Gold Wing Tour models, including a readout of the actual front and rear pressure in PSI is a premium touch.COMFORTElectric WindscreenYou’ll notice a couple of things about the Gold Wing’s windscreen. First, it’s electrically controlled, moving both up and down over an 4.9-inch range for the Gold Wing Tour (4.1 inches for the Gold Wing) as well as changing its angle as it raises and lowers. Plus, it automatically remembers the last setting. Because you sit closer to the windscreen, it has a narrower, lower, more sporting profile, yet still offers excellent protection.Year: 2020Make: HondaModel: Gold Wing Tour Automatic DCT Pearl Glare WhiteCondition: UsedTrimStock: P21067Condition: UsedVIN: JH2SC7959LK200169To see similar inventory copy and past this link into your browser.www.southernhonda.comSouthern Honda Powersports5330 Ringgold RoadEast Ridge, TN 37412Ask for: SalesSales: (800) 959-5432A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 34264468 10386644Honda Gold Wing Tour Automatic DCT Pearl Glare White  Honda Gold Wing Tour Automatic DCT Pearl Glare White",,

And over the years, our engineers have always stayed true to that vision, but they’ve strived to make the bike better and better. Our 2021 model is a perfect example of that. Refinements abound, but the best parts remain the same. You’ll still have your choice of both manual-transmission models and Gold Wings featuring our exclusive automatic DCT transmission, but this year the trunk is bigger for more road-trip storage, the speakers have a higher 45-watt rating, and the passenger seat on our Tour models is improved. We also freshened up some styling touches, like solid red tail lights and paint choices—check out the grey with orange accent stripe on our no-trunk models! Plus, all Gold Wings are now Android Auto compatible, as well as offering Apple CarPlay™. All in all, a truly great motorcycle gets even better—so your dream ride has everything you’ll need to make memories that last a lifetime.Features may include:PERFORMANCEENGINEThe Gold Wing’s horizontally opposed six-cylinder engine is famously smooth and powerful.

That’s because we’ve made the Gold Wing’s trunk bigger. It now holds 61 liters, up 11 liters from last year’s models. That means in most cases you can get two XXL full-face helmets in there. Combined, the trunk and saddlebags give you 121 liters of storage, plenty to hold what you need for a weekend’s travels. Accessories include an integrated brake light, an auto-on interior light, and a luggage rack.Year: 2021Make: HondaModel: Gold WingCondition: NewTrim: TourStock: 3MK300547Condition: NewVIN: JH2SC7903MK300547To see similar inventory copy and past this link into your browser.www.southernhonda.comSouthern Honda Powersports5330 Ringgold RoadEast Ridge, TN 37412Ask for: SalesSales: (800) 959-5432A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 33413840 10368629Honda Gold Wing Tour  Honda Gold Wing Tour",,

The adapter gives the bike a horizontal top tube so that the bike hangs on the rack properly. Non-standard frames are a real pain to strap onto a rack, often ending up hanging crooked and not too secure.  These are very secure. Easy to get on and off. One end of it clips on the handlebar stem under the bars and the other end clips under the seat.  The adapter telescopes longer or shorter to fit the bike.  The adapter becomes the bike's top tube that gets strapped into the rack.  I don't believe bike shops have these currently because of the shortages.   Can meet in a public place.
