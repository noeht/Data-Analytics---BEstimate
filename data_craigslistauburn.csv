The adapter gives the bike a horizontal top tube so that the bike hangs on the rack properly. Non-standard frames are a real pain to strap onto a rack, often ending up hanging crooked and not too secure.  These are very secure. Easy to get on and off. One end of it clips on the handlebar stem under the bars and the other end clips under the seat.  The adapter telescopes longer or shorter to fit the bike.  The adapter becomes the bike's top tube that gets strapped into the rack.  I don't believe bike shops have these currently because of the shortages.   Can meet in a public place.

Massive brake rotors up to 220mm 34mm gold tube forks on some models up to 140mm travel Wider range of models  A proper e-Mountain bike needs to be mid-drive and have full suspension, it's as simple as that. Until now, if you wanted an electric mountain bike to tackle rugged trails, your choices have been heavy, low-quality, fat tire, hub-motor beach bikes, or legacy brands charging $4000 or more for low-power eBikes without full suspension.   Whether your knees are tired or you just want to shred, there is simply no better choice for performance and value than Cyberbike. An American company with great customer support: Cyberbike, USA. The mountains are calling. Will you answer?  Cyberbike eBikes come all with the quietest and most powerful motor in its class, with a long range (65 miles and more) battery, and powerful e-spec hydraulic disk brakes that will be there when you need them. A lightweight package with 500 watts of power, top-of-the-line battery range, and quality components, all for the price of an inexpensive yet stellar bike! You'll get so much more than other eBikes with the CyberBike, it's the real e-MTB experience for the adventurous rider. Performance, specs, and quality components throughout, and the best warranty in the industry, from an American company with experienced American mechanics on call for all your tech support needs.  54 volt/500 watt climbing power with 13Amp hour Li-Ion battery and only 52 lbs means you'll get power and tons of battery range. Now with available throttle! Now from only $2495 Note: Owning and riding comes with risks. Wear proper protection, properly maintain and check your bike, and ride within your limits.

The bike was completely disassembled, deep cleaned, and rebuilt, piece by piece. It has new stainless steel cables, new cable housings, and new internal ball bearings. Everything works perfectly. And it rides nice and smooth.... Better than new, as mass assembled bikes don't get a mechanic's touch during build-out, often needing grease around the bearings and adjustments to most components. This one also had cheap galvanized cables on it that would rust. Those have all been replaced.  The bike has a 15 inch frame measured from the bottom bracket to the top of the seat tube. I would call this a medium size bike. A rider around 5ft5 to around 6'0 should fit fine.  The bike was completely disassembled. All the components and the drivetrain were removed, deep-cleaned, and adjusted. The front shock was removed and the headset bearings were replaced, greased, and the headset was adjusted. The wheelhub bearings were all replaced, greased, and adjusted. The internal cups and cones where all these bearings travel were all deep-cleaned to provide the cleanest and smoothest surface possible. The wheelhubs are now buttery smooth. The bottom bracket was rebuilt with new ball bearings and fresh grease, and tightened correctly. The wheels were trued, the rims and spokes were individually cleaned. The frame was cleaned and polished. The brake calipers and levers, shifters, derailleurs, cranks and chainrings, and drivetrain were all disassembled and rebuilt. There's not a nut or bolt on the bike I haven't touched.  This is a 21-speed comfort road bike with a step thru frame. The bike has street tires(700c). It has a front shock. The bike has Shimano Tourney derailleurs. It has a Shimano grip shifters. The bike has a shock absorbing seat post and matching seat and grips. The wheels have lightweight alloy rims and hubs, and have nice tires with excellent tread. The bike also has an alloy stem, alloy handlebar, and alloy seatpost to keep things light-ish. The frame is very pretty and is in like new condition.  Due to the vast amount of spam, please put the word DOG into your email and I will reply.   Use the ""more ads by this user"" link to see my other bikes. Link is located on the right side of the ad.    Old grease, combined with dirt, will harden and damage the operation of the bearings. This will cause internal damage, and can make your bike dangerous(especially with the headset bearings which allow you to steer). If you're looking to buy any used bike, find out when the last time the bearings were overhauled (not just a ""tune-up""). If it has not been done in 5 yrs, I strongly recommend having it done.",,,, aluminum, road,,, 15 inch,,, 700C,,,

The owner was asked what color he preferred. Trek repainted it, and applied the decals and clear coat.   I have disassembled the frame, fork, and components. They were cleaned, regreased where needed, and reassembled.  The headset and bottom bracket are both very smooth. The frame and fork are in very pretty condition.
