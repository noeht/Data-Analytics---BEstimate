And after your first ride, you’ll know why. The engine makes tremendous, instant power, thanks to Honda’s exclusive Unicam® design. The chassis is an active part of the handling equation, backed up with premium Showa suspension at both ends. But what the spec charts can’t show is the level of refinement that only Honda brings to the class, all with the goal of letting you rail through the corners, flatten out the whoops, ace the rhythm sections and do it lap after lap with incredible precision.Looking for the best of the best? Then check out our CRF450RWE (WE for Works Edition). We’ve fine-tuned it with special touches like an exclusive Yoshimura exhaust, Twin Air filter, Throttle Jockey seat cover, Hinson clutch basket and cover, premium DID DirtStar LT-X rims, Kashima and titanium nitrate-coated forks, a red cylinder head cover, and hands-on touches like special cylinder-head porting. Both the RWE and the CRF450R get suspension and engine setting changes for 2022, sharpening the best bike on the track even a little more. Ready to win? Because we’re ready to ride.Features may include:HANDLINGLIGHT NARROW FRAMEGreat handling starts with a superior frame, and that’s one place where the CRF450R’s chassis puts you out front. First, it’s light—over a pound and a half lighter than the previous generation’s. By making the frame’s main spars narrow, we save weight, but more important we make the chassis more responsive by fine-tuning the lateral rigidity. The result is a bike that gets into, around, and out of corners faster.ENGINEERINGHYDRAULIC CLUTCHThe CRF450R features the first hydraulically actuated clutch we’ve offered outside of our works bikes. Made by Nissin, it’s the same design as in our Grand Prix MX machines, and performs better than third-party conversions. You get a clutch-lever pull that’s ten percent lighter at its peak, even though it’s paired with a new, stronger 8-plate clutch. Plus, you’ll never have to worry about making a clutch-cable adjustment, even during the longest events.CONVENIENCESEALED AIRBOX AND FILTERAlong with the special air filter, the airbox shape helps deliver more torque. You can access the airbox through the left number plate. And because the CRF450R’s filter has no rubber gasket where it interfaces with the intake boot, cleaning and servicing the filter is faster and less messy than ever.PERFORMANCEEXCLUSIVE WORKS EDITIONSimply stated, the best of the best. The CRF450RWE Works Edition includes all the standard CRF450R features, but also gets a special hand-ported cylinder head; Hinson clutch basket and cover; Twin Air filter, Throttle Jockey graphics and seat cover; upgraded DID DirtStar LT-X rims; an exclusive Yoshimura exhaust system including a titanium header; titanium nitride-coated lower fork legs; revalved suspension; an RK gold chain; special ECU settings; and black triple clamps.

Which is why we’re offering two models of our new Honda Talon—probably the most anticipated side-by-sides ever. Both share the same powerful, Talon-specific high-output engine, quick-shifting Automatic DCT Transmission, exclusive I-4WD technology package and all-new chassis. Rider comfort? Nobody does it like Honda. Performance? We’ve built our reputation on it. The key differences between the two: The Talon 1000R has a longer wheelbase, a wider vehicle track, and more suspension travel. It’s a perfect match for riders who tackle rugged, high-speed terrain. The Talon 1000R is proof positive that life is better, side by side.Features may include:ENGINEPOWERFUL 999cc TWIN-CYLINDER ENGINESport side-by-sides need power, and you’re sure to find the new Talon 1000R offers plenty of it. The Talon 1000R’s 999cc liquid-cooled inline twin delivers the kind of powerful torque and quick-revving horsepower you’d expect from a flagship sport model, but is equally responsive in lower revs and in the critical midrange too. Set longitudinally in the chassis and managed by Honda’s sophisticated PGM-FI engine-mapping system, it delivers the kind of refinement no other side-by-side can match.UNICAM CYLINDER HEAD DESIGNThe Talon 1000R’s 999cc liquid-cooled inline twin uses the same proven Unicam® cylinder head design found in our championship-winning motocross bikes. That helps make the engine more compact, which lets us position it for optimal weight distribution and ground clearance.CHASSISCHASSIS AND SUSPENSIONThe Talon 1000R’s refined, high-performance chassis forms the basis for its superior handling and stability. From there we add long-travel independent front and rear suspension and generous ground clearance. Plus, the Talon 1000R gets premium, FOX Podium 2.5 shocks with QS-3 quick adjustors on all four corners.DRIVETRAINAUTOMATIC SIX-SPEED DCT TRANSMISSIONThe convenience of an automatic with the strength, control, and efficiency of a manual, Honda’s DCT lets you drive the way you want. Choose between manual mode or fully automatic. Plus, the addition of Sport Mode increases the fun, shifting at higher RPMs for a spirited, full-performance driving experience. DCT puts you in control as to what engine speed you want, and what gear ratio. Or you can let it do all the thinking for you. In addition, you also get genuine compression braking and a more efficient power delivery than a belt-driven CVT.Sunrise Pre-Owned Motorsports3201 East Park PlazaSearcy, AR 72143Ask for: Pre-Owned Sales5013052900: (501) 305-2900A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 34240346 10380727",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Or maybe you just want to have some fun outdoors, and don’t want to leave anyone behind. No problem—that’s why we offer our Honda Pioneer 1000-5 models. With room for five occupants, they feature the same smart technology, superior materials, and refined engineering as our three-seat Pioneer 1000 side-by-sides, along with Honda’s world-famous reputation for reliability and quality.Features may include:ENGINEERINGI-4WDThe Pioneer 1000-5 Limited Edition showcases our exclusive I-4WD system. Think “I” for “Intelligent,” because that’s exactly what it is. An industry-first brake-traction control system for side-by-sides, it simplifies operation, increases drivability and optimizes traction. Using proven, advanced technology from Honda’s automotive division, you get the benefits associated with a locked front differential with none of the downsides. That means it maintains front-wheel traction even if one wheel wants to spin on ice or mud or if it’s in a hole. But at the same time, you get the lighter steering, better tracking at high speeds, tighter turning radius, and reduced kickback associated with unlocked front differentials.PERFORMANCEPOWERFUL 999cc TWIN-CYLINDER ENGINEWhen you know the power you need is always at the ready, every drive is an enjoyable experience. And that’s precisely what you get out of the class-leading 999cc liquid-cooled inline twin. Using the same Unicam® cylinder head design found in our motocross bikes, it’s more compact in size, and it still delivers the kind of horsepower and torque you’d expect from a flagship model.HANDLINGCHASSIS AND SUSPENSIONPrepare to go further than ever before. Our refined chassis enables you to tackle terrain others would shy away from, with larger tires, long-travel independent front and rear suspension and huge ground clearance. The rubber mounted engine and exhaust system insulates against excessive vibration and the self-leveling rear suspension compensation for changing loads. Plus, the Pioneer 1000-5 Limited Edition gets premium, quick-adjust FOX QS-3 shocks on all four corners.VERSATILITYQUICKFLIP® SEATINGWant to bring an extra one or two passengers along for the ride? Two QuickFlip® seats pop up from the cargo bed on Pioneer 1000-5 models, giving you the extra seating you need, when you need it. Exclusive to Honda, it’s a smarter system than fixed seat, multi-row models, giving you better maneuverability on the trails.COMFORT3-PERSON CONTOURED BENCH SEATTough, durable and built to enhance every driving experience — yes, we’re talking about the seat. Contoured for three passengers, the center seat is positioned up and forward to maximize space and comfort, and the covering is designed to resist both the elements and heavy use.LCD DISPLAYThe multi-function LCD dash display is large enough to host loads of information, in an easy-to-read way, like speed and fuel level. RPM and transmission mode. Fuel gauge, water temperature, trip information and more. It even includes a clock, so you’ll always know when it’s time for some fun.SAFETYDRIVER/PASSENGER PROTECTIONThe Occupant Protection Structure uses large-diameter tubing, and meets OSHA’s rollover protection standard. The hard doors and roll-up side nets help keep debris from entering the cabin, and auto-style three-point seatbelts are equipped with an emergency locking retractor mechanism, to help optimize passenger security. When you put this much safety first, fun is sure to follow.Sunrise Pre-Owned Motorsports3201 East Park PlazaSearcy, AR 72143Ask for: Pre-Owned Sales5013052900: (501) 305-2900A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 34240350 10380696",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You’re not the only one. With its blacked-out styling and great new colors for 2019, this bike will turn heads everywhere you go. And sure, the Rebel is one of our most popular bikes, but it’s also one of our most fun to ride. It has a compact frame and a low-slung seat. You can lean it over in turns due to an impressive tilt angle, and its 471cc parallel-twin engine is specially tuned for power in the middle and upper revs. Plus, it’s begging to be customized, so you can easily make it your own. Express yourself on a Rebel 500 today!Features may include:SPORTY ENGINETwin-cylinder engines are a great choice for a machine like the Rebel 500. Honda twins are famous for their versatility, and the 471cc Rebel 500’s engine is one of our best ever. The parallel-twin engine is narrow, which helps reduce overall bike size. Plus it offers lots of low-rpm torque, but plenty of higher-rpm performance.BLACKED-OUT STYLEThe Rebel is a blank canvas for your self expression. But unlike the canvas you buy at the art store, this one’s not boring white. As is, its black-out engine pieces, frame, and bodywork elements look great during the day and even better at night.LOW SEAT HEIGHTWhen it comes to seat heights, almost everyone likes them lower. At just 27.2 inches, the Rebel has one of the lowest seats in anyone’s lineup. It’s comfortable when you ride, and it makes it easier to flat-foot it at stoplights or in parking lots.SUPERIOR HANDLINGA lot of today’s motorcycles look great standing still, but disappoint once the road gets twisty. At Honda, we set high standards for the way all our bikes handle and feel, and the Rebel is a perfect example—we’ve paid just as much attention to the way this bike corners and handles as we have its knockout styling.Sunrise Pre-Owned Motorsports3201 East Park PlazaSearcy, AR 72143Ask for: Pre-Owned Sales5013052900: (501) 305-2900A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 31997213 10361077",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And over the years, our engineers have always stayed true to that vision, but they’ve strived to make the bike better and better. Our 2021 model is a perfect example of that. Refinements abound, but the best parts remain the same. You’ll still have your choice of both manual-transmission models and Gold Wings featuring our exclusive automatic DCT transmission, but this year the trunk is bigger for more road-trip storage, the speakers have a higher 45-watt rating, and the passenger seat on our Tour models is improved. We also freshened up some styling touches, like solid red tail lights and paint choices—check out the grey with orange accent stripe on our no-trunk models! Plus, all Gold Wings are now Android Auto compatible, as well as offering Apple CarPlay™. All in all, a truly great motorcycle gets even better—so your dream ride has everything you’ll need to make memories that last a lifetime.Features may include:PERFORMANCEENGINEThe Gold Wing’s horizontally opposed six-cylinder engine is famously smooth and powerful. The latest version is an 1833cc design that’s over 13 pounds lighter than the previous generation (more than 8 pounds for the DCT versions).HANDLINGDOUBLE WISHBONE FRONT SUSPENSIONOne look and your eyes will immediately go to the Gold Wing’s radical, Honda-engineered double-wishbone front suspension. The innovative design changes the path the wheel travels through the suspension stroke, and that lets us move both the engine and the rider/passenger closer to the front wheel. You get more room, and stellar handling.ENGINEERINGTHROTTLE BY WIREThe 2021 Gold Wing’s throttle-by-wire system enables features like the bike’s four ride modes and our exclusive Honda Selectable Torque Control (HSTC), available on our Gold Wing Tour models.COMFORT AND CARGONEW LARGER TRUNKHere’s some big news for 2021—or should we say bigger news? That’s because we’ve made the Gold Wing’s trunk bigger. It now holds 61 liters, up 11 liters from last year’s models. That means in most cases you can get two XXL full-face helmets in there. Combined, the trunk and saddlebags give you 121 liters of storage, plenty to hold what you need for a weekend’s travels. Accessories include an integrated brake light, an auto-on interior light, and a luggage rack.Sunrise Pre-Owned Motorsports3201 East Park PlazaSearcy, AR 72143Ask for: Pre-Owned Sales5013052900: (501) 305-2900A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 34309084 10406589",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using wireless connectivity to talk to the bike’s onboard CAN-bus network, the app allows owners to adjust air/fuel mixture and ignition timing maps to tune engine performance for track conditions, record race log information, and monitor a range of data such as maintenance and system diagnosis, engine run time, and more.Electric Starter SystemThe YZ250F features a compact electric starter system to minimize restart delays on track and add convenience everywhere else. Powered by a high-capacity and ultra-lightweight, four-cell lithium-ion battery, the system adds minimal weight.CHASSIS/SUSPENSIONAdvanced Aluminum FrameThe YZ250F’s compact frame refines the instinctive handling that makes this Yamaha one of the best handling machines in the class. Large upper frame bracing improves rigidity and durability, while wider rear frame spars and YZ250F-specific engine mounts centralize mass for the best possible balance of bump absorption, stiffness and feeling of grip.Compact Body and Seat DesignThe YZ250F utilizes compact bodywork from tip to tail, including a narrow fuel tank specifically designed for motocross demands. In addition to shaving weight, the body design provides more comfortable knee grip and control feel, with a seat shaped to give the rider additional room to move aboard the machine.Enhanced Mass-CentralizationThe engine, aluminum muffler and compact fuel tank are positioned close to the machine's center of mass. This layout contributes to centralized mass for a lightweight handling feeling on the track. The wide 55mm footpegs help lower the rider's center of gravity for enhanced machine balance, control and rider comfort.ADDITIONALAdjustable Handlebar MountsThe 4-position adjustable handlebar mounts are rubber mounted to improve comfort and reduce handlebar vibration, while the alloy handlebar centralize overall mass.Embedded GraphicsYamaha’s unique embedded graphics are built into the bodywork for extended durability, resisting both peeling and damage.Race Winning DetailsThe YZ250F includes top-spec details, including 1-1/8” aluminum tapered handlebars, wide 55mm footpegs, a quick-adjust clutch perch, stylish blue rims and gold chain.Basic Information:Year: 2020Make: YamahaModel: YZTrim: 250FStock Number: U016061Condition: UsedType: Off-RoadTitle: CleanBrakes:Front Brake: Hydraulic DiscFront Brake Diameter (in): 10.6Front Brake Diameter (mm): 270Rear Brake: Hydraulic DiscRear Brake Diameter (in): 9.7Rear Brake Diameter (mm): 245Chassis & Suspension:Frame: AluminumFront Adjustable Fork Pre-LoadFront Adjustable Rebound DampingFront Suspension Brand Name: KYBFront Suspension Type: Inverted ForkFront Travel (in): 12.2Front Travel (mm): 309.9Number Rear Shock Absorbers: 1Rear Adjustable Rebound DampingRear Adjustable Shock / Spring Pre-LoadRear Suspension Brand Name: KYBRear Suspension Material: AluminumRear Suspension Type: Twin Sided Swing ArmRear Travel (in): 12.5Rear Travel (mm): 317.5Comfort:Adjustable HandlebarsAdjustable LeversDrivetrain:Number Of Speeds: 5Primary Drive (Rear Wheel): ChainTransmission: ManualEngine:Bore (in): 3.03Bore (mm): 77Carburetion Brand: MikuniCarburetion Type: Fuel InjectedCompression Ratio: 13.8Cooling System: LiquidCylinders: 1Engine Disp. to Weight (cc): 1.07Engine Size (cc): 249Engine Size (ci): 15.2Engine Stroke: 4-StrokeEngine Type: Single-CylinderFuel Capacity (gal): 1.6Fuel InjectorFuel Injector Size (mm): 44Fuel Requirements: RegularStarter: ElectricStroke (in): 2.11Stroke (mm): 53.6Valve Configuration: DOHCValves: 4Valves Per Cylinder: 4Other Information:Chain GuardChassis ProtectorsChromed WheelsExterior CoversExterior GuardsFoot PegsFoot Peg Location: DriverFork GuardsFront FenderHand GripsRear FenderSpecifications:Body Material: PlasticFront Tire (Full Spec): Bridgestone Battlecross X20F 80/100 R21Front Tire (Inches): 21Front Tire Aspect Ratio: 100Front Tire Speed Rating: 51MFront Tire Width: 80Fuel Capacity (liters): 6Ground Clearance (in): 13.2Ground Clearance (mm): 335.3Height (inches): 50Height (mm): 1285.2Length (inches): 85Length (mm): 2174.2Rear Tire (Full Spec): Bridgestone Battlecross X20R 100/90 R19Rear Tire (Inches): 19Rear Tire Aspect Ratio: 90Rear Tire Speed Rating: 57MRear Tire Width: 100Seat Height (inches): 38Tube / Tubeless: TubedWet Weight (kg): 106.1Wet Weight (lbs): 234Wheelbase (in): 58.1Wheelbase (mm): 1475.7Wheels Composition: AluminumWidth (inches): 32Width (mm): 825.5VICARS POWERSPORTS1904 S MAINMCALESTER, OK 74501Ask for: SalesPrimary Phone: (918) 423-3306A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 34007564 10354159",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They let you ride just about anywhere. Plus, their upright seating and sensible riding position let you rack up the miles in comfort. But they face a challenge, too: they need to combine state-of-the-art touring and riding technology with total reliability.And that’s why Honda Africa Twin models are so far out in front of all the rest. Technology? Check out things like Apple CarPlay™, Android Auto™, and of course our available automatic DCT transmission. Reliability? Nobody even comes close to Honda there. Comfort? Hey, you’re talking about the people who build the Gold Wing. Off-road performance? Ever heard of the Baja 1000 or the Dakar Rally? All that expertise goes into every Africa Twin we build.For 2022 we’re offering four different Africa Twin models. Our standard Africa Twin is a great choice for serious off-road enthusiasts, with either a six-speed manual transmission or our optional DCT. For long-distance adventure touring, check out our two Africa Twin Adventure Sports ES models: They offer special features like electronically controlled suspension, an adjustable windscreen, larger fuel tank, heated grips, tubeless tires, and more. They too are available with either manual transmission or DCT. And every Africa Twin in our line features Android Auto this year, along with new control settings and a tasty new color choice.Features may include:POWER1084cc TWIN-CYLINDER ENGINEThe CRF1100L Africa Twin sports one of the best engines ever in an adventure bike. The parallel-twin design is narrow, and delivers torque everywhere from idle to redline. You’ll have more grunt down low, and cruise easy on the open road.ENGINEERINGCRUISE CONTROLHere’s one of the worst-kept secrets in the motorcycling world—Honda Africa Twins make great long-distance touring bikes. To that end, we’ve equipped our Africa Twin models with cruise control, just like our Gold Wings. Your next adventure really starts a couple of hundred miles away? No problem!HANDLINGLONG-TRAVEL FRONT SUSPENSIONThe Africa Twin doesn’t just look like an adventure bike—it’s the real deal. Exhibit A: Check out its long-travel front suspension. The inverted Showa fork is fully adjustable with huge 45mm tubes and 9.1 inches of travel—the most front-end travel in the 1000cc off-road class.CONVENIENCEApple CarPlay™ AND ANDROID AUTO™ Apple CarPlay™* seamlessly integrates your compatible iPhone®* into your new Africa Twin, and Android Auto™ does the same for your Android phone. That means you can use your devices to access maps, music, and other services easily. You’ll have access to weather, playlists and telephone numbers while aboard. Available Bluetooth®-enabled wireless headsets let you communicate more easily than ever. And best of all, with more apps available every day, your bike’s technology and convenience remain on the cutting edge.Sunrise Honda of Rogers1050 WEST HUDSON RD.Rogers, AR 72756Ask for: SALES STAFFPrimary Phone: (479) 903-7373A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 34305924 10416590",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RIDE FARTHER.Has there ever been a time when we’ve appreciated a bike like the Honda Gold Wing as much as we do today? It’s designed to let you get out and explore—and to share that precious time with a like-minded companion. You’ll discover (or rediscover) just how much we all need to reconnect with the great outdoors. With its famously smooth 1833 six-cylinder engine, refined bodywork for weather protection, and ample luggage, where you go—and for how long—is totally up to you. Plus, this latest generation of Gold Wing is lighter and more agile, with a level of performance most touring bikes can only dream of. Full of innovative engineering, all Gold Wing models are Android Auto™ compatible, as well as offering Apple CarPlay™ integration. You can choose between a conventional six-speed transmission and Honda’s exclusive automatic seven-speed DCT transmission, depending on the model. And make sure you check out the new color options for 2022!Features may include:PERFORMANCEENGINEThe Gold Wing’s horizontally opposed six-cylinder engine is famously smooth and powerful. The latest version is an 1833cc design that’s over 13 pounds lighter than the previous generation (more than 8 pounds for the DCT versions).HANDLINGDOUBLE WISHBONE FRONT SUSPENSIONOne look and your eyes will immediately go to the Gold Wing’s radical, Honda-engineered double-wishbone front suspension. The innovative design lets us move both the engine and the rider/passenger closer to the front wheel, giving you more room for added comfort as well as stellar handling. ENGINEERINGTHROTTLE BY WIREThe 2022 Gold Wing’s throttle-by-wire system enables features like the bike’s four ride modes and our exclusive Honda Selectable Torque Control (HSTC).COMFORT AND CARGOLARGER TRUNKThe Gold Wing’s trunk now holds 61 liters, up 11 liters from the 2020 model.

Here is a glimpse at just the top ten uses of utility trailers:  1.Automobiles: From time to time it becomes necessary to haul an inoperable car or truck. Tow trucks are expensive, especially if the distance is great. A utility trailer is a great way to haul vehicles and a good investment if you need to do so regularly.  2.Boats: If you have a boat, you will need a utility trailer to get it to and from the water.  3.Lawn Care Equipment: If you live in a rural area, you may find that you need to haul your mowing equipment from one piece of your property to another. Packing equipment and loading it into a pickup truck bed can get old very quickly. A utility trailer will allow you to drive your equipment right up onto the trailer without the aid of ramps or two strong men.  4.Furniture: Moving furniture is a breeze with a utility trailer. Furniture dollies roll right up onto the trailer and you can haul more than you can with a pickup.  5.Building Supplies: Do you have projects that need to be done around the house? Pick up your own building supplies and save on delivery fees.  6.Bikes, Motorcycles, and ATVs: Recreational vehicles are best hauled on a utility trailer.  7.Livestock: An enclosed utility trailer is most often used to haul livestock.  8.Auction and Flea Markets: If you frequent auctions and flea markets, you will need the hauling capability to bring home your inexpensive and rare finds.  9.Appliances: Utility trailers are ideal for hauling appliances.  10.Debris and Trash: Loading trash in and out of your pickup bed can be cumbersome and clean up can be messy, but it would be worse to have to haul trash in your SUV. Clean up after a big job is a lot easier with a utility trailer.  As you can see, there are many reasons why an investment in a utility trailer is a smart move. I'm sure that with a little time, and its easy availability, you will come up with even more ways to use a trailer  ATV UTV SXS MOTORCYCLE BIKE TRANSPORT HAUL MOVE CAR TRUCK MOVING TRAVELING STORAGE CARGO LOADS AUTHORITY BOAT HAULING BUSINESS BUSINESS FOR SALE JOB SALES CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT STEEL RAZOR SNOWMOBILE POLARIS YAHAMA WILD CAT MACHINE AUTOMOBILE AUTO VAN TOWING TOW VECHICLE SNOW RAIN BOX TRUCK FLATBED GOOSNECK BUMPER PULL HITCH BALL WEATHER BUY WOOD Westchester County, NY Amawalk, Annsville, Archville, Ardsley, Ardsley-on-Hudson, Armawalk, Armonk, Arthur Manor, Banksville, Bayberry Park, Bedford, Bedford Center, Bedford Hills, Beech Hill, Beechmont, Beechmont Woods, Bonnie Crest, Boutonville, Briarcliff Manor, Bronxville, Bronxville Heights, Bryn Mawr Park, Buchanan, Buckhout Corners, Butlerville, Cecil Park, Cedar Knolls, Chappaqua, Chauncey, Chester Hill Park, Chimney Corners, Colonial Acres, Colonial Heights, Crestwood, Crestwood Gardens, Crompond, Cross River, Croton Falls, Croton Heights, Croton-on-Hudson, Crotonville, Crugers, Dobbs Ferry, Dunwoodie, Dunwoodie Heights, East Irvington, East White Plains, East Woods, Eastchester, Eastview, Elmsford, Elmsmere, Fairview, Fleetwood, Forest Knolls, Fox Meadow, Furnace Woods, Gallows Hill, Glendale, Glenville, Glenwood, Goldens Bridge, Graham, Granite Springs, Grant Corner, Greenhaven, Greenville, Grey Oaks, Greystone, Gunther Park, Harrison, Hartsdale, Hastings-on-Hudson, Hawthorne, Heath Ridge, Heathcote, Heritage Hills, Homestead Park, Horseshoe Hill, Horton Estates, Huguenot Park, Irvington, Isle of San Souci, Jefferson Valley, Katonah, Kitchawan, Lake Katonah, Lake Lincolndale, Lake Mohegan, Lake Purdy, Larchmont, Lawrence Park, Lewisboro, Lincoln, Lincolndale, Lowerre, Ludlow, Mamaroneck, Maplewood, Mariandale, Millwood, Milton, Mohegan Heights, Mohegan Lake, Montrose, Mount Airy, Mount Hope, Mount Kisco, Mount Pleasant, Mount Vernon, Murdock Woods, Murray Hill, Nepera Park, Nepperhan, New Rochelle, North Salem, North White Plains, Oceola Lake, Orienta, Oscawana, Ossining, Park Hill, Parkside, Peekskill, Pelham, Pelham Manor, Philipse Manor, Pinebrook, Pinebrook Heights, Pleasantside, Pleasantville, Pocantico Hills, Port Chester, Pound Ridge, Purchase, Purdys, Purdys Grove, Quaker Ridge, Quarry Heights, Residence Park, Ridgeway, Rochelle Heights, Rochelle Park, Roe Park, Rosedale, Rye, Rye Brook, Salem Center, Sarles Corners, Scarborough, Scarsdale, Scarsdale Downs, Scarsdale Park, Scotts Corners, Secor Gardens, Shenorock, Sherman Park, Shore Acres, Shrub Oak, Sleepy Hollow, Sleepy Hollow Manor, Somers, South Salem, Sparta, Spring Valley, Stanwood, Sun Haven, Sunny Brae, Tarrytown, Thornwood, Toddville, Tompkins Corners, Tuckahoe, Twin Lakes Village, Valhalla, Valley Pond Estates, Van Cortlandtville, Vernon Park, Verplanck, Victory Park, Vista, Waccabuc, Waverly, West Mount Vernon, White Birches, White Plains, Whitehall Corners, Wilmot Woods, Windmill Farm, Woodlands, Woodybrook, Worthington, Wykagyl, Wykagyl Park, Yonkers, Yorktown, Yorktown Heights, brooklyn, queens, manhattan, nyc, bronx, staten island, long island, hudson valley",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bike is in excellent condition, has less than 6000 miles. All maintenance has been done and kept up with. I am second owner, bike only had 2700 miles on it when I bought it last spring. Bike trans has 3 riding modes, drive, sport and manual paddle shift. Very convenient for all types of ridding. Shifts very smooth. I am selling bike due to health reasons. Bike has a GIVI tall windscreen, ""stock shorty"" included. Bike has a GIVI 52-liter rear trunk that can be removed with key to take in hotel, Honda hard lockable saddle bags, crash bars with tip over sliders to protect faring and tank. Bike comes with 2 fairly new helmets "" large and a small"" with built in blue tooth coms that can also blue tooth to your phone for whatever you need, music can be interrupted when receiving phone calls. USB power supply and phone holder. Bike also comes with battery tender and bike cover. Now the important stuff. NO TEST RIDES unless you have cash in hand! Also, please don't contact me saying ""you are asking over book value"" NADA, Kelly blue book, and J.D. Powel are way under what these bikes are actually selling for! My friend and neighbor rode mine and wanted one. He searched for 8 months doing searching every dealer and private seller within 300 miles and could not get one. Every time he found one it sold before he could send in a deposit, and all were well over book value. He finally got a 2014 with 34,000 miles for $6850 and we had to do some work to it. Do some searching before contacting me. If you can find one this nice with only 6,000 miles on it for book value, BUY it. Might consider trades as I am looking for a full-size camper van or maybe a conversion van. Possibly a Unimog or just something unique like an ultra-lite plane or motor sail.  Please text only as I don't answer un-known calls. 5zero1627-3zero25. Thanks for your time.

One owner, meticulously maintained, always garaged, in very good condition.  Two-tone color: Mysterious Red/Cayenne.  True 49-State bike - I have ridden this bike to every state except Hawaii, and it still has plenty of get-up-and-go.  The only non-stock thing on the bike is the radio antennas - old whip antennas replaced with short “stubs” when they wore out.  Cruise control, heated handgrips, security system, touchscreen navigation, radio, CB, cargo rack.  Front tire good, rear tire nearly new.  Extras: sheepskin seat cushion, 3 helmets, rain gear, orange safety vest, intercom system, external bag for mounting on cargo rack, and more.  Similar bikes are listed for ~$20K on Autotrader, but the dealer will only pay me about half the Kelley Blue Book trade-in value.  I'd rather see someone else get a good deal than the dealer make a mint off the bike they assured me would hold its value.  Text, email, or leave a voicemail message. Three-213010116.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(See last few paragraphs for Trade information)  One/operator bike (me) purchased it brand new out of Bossier City, Louisiana through Rock Powersports in August of 2017.  I have maintained the bike by completing every preventative maintenance task setup for it in its owner’s manual as the date/mileage becomes closer to the scheduled time to perform said task.  Mileage: 2,057 miles, most recent replaced part.  OEM Engine air filter.   Average MPG throughout my ownership:  Between 56.5-58.3 miles per gallon.  (This is under varying degrees of speed, acceleration, not to mention sitting in large amounts of traffic during busier hours of any given day just idling for several minutes just to stop and go a little further and do it again.)  This is a 100% stock 2017 YZF-R3 ABS that has been adult operated and owned by myself since new and has not been flogged to hell and back nor abused.  It has never been scraped, bumped, and irrelevant to what the people think who drop their bikes, this bike has never laid too far in either direction let alone been dropped.    I’ve kept my R3 in my garage at all times other than to ride out and back into the garage upon arriving back home from work or running small errands.  It will do more than interstate legal speeds.  Keep in mind that motorcycles are much more sensitive to larger amounts of weight and operate far different than when “loaded down” versus not weighed down.  The power/weight ratio is more crucial on smaller displacement engines than a ""HOG.""  The mileage is substantially lower than it should be, but the miles are true and most importantly they are well maintained miles.  Finally for anyone that might be interested in Trades? I have a clear title and the original owner’s manual with all the maintenance done recorded within it.     1.	As for trades, I really would like a fairly new riding mower, a zero turn preferable, but something else in really great condition that is within a year to 2 years old at most I’d be willing to look at.   2.	I would be interested in a trade for either a clean example of the following cars, or a possible trade with cash on mine or your end depending on nice or not so nice the car is.   1996-2004 Ponitac Grand Prix GTP, 2004-2005 Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS, Buick Park Avenue “Ultra”, the 1996-1999 Buick Riviera,  1996-2003 Pontiac Bonneville SSEI, a 1996-1999 Oldsmobile Eighty-Eight LSS (Limited)  last but not least a 2003/2004 Buick Regal GSX/SLP **The above list of cars should have the L67 Series II GM 3800 Supercharged Engine in them, I have no use for any car above that doesn’t have the L67 engine Thank you!*  3 .Lastly Trade wise, if you have aftermarket parts of high quality (not ebay parts) for a 2003-2005 Nissan 350Z (VQ35DE Non-Revup Engine) in good usable condition I would love to hear from you.   I know there are a whole bunch of 350z guys out there.    Pretty firm on the price but that said I do not mind saving the purchaser money when it comes to registering it as the sales tax here compared to other states is basically exploitation, price gouging if you will?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And we’re not talking about just balancing on two wheels: We’re talking about the balance between size, weight, power and handling that makes some bikes great. Like the new Honda CRF300L. Based on our previous CRF250Ls, for 2021, they now feature larger engines with more torque and a whole host of other refinements. What you end up with are two of the best-balanced bikes ever for on- and off-road use. Perfect for weekend trail rides, they’re also among the best choices ever for commuting or urban transportation. Pure and simple, these two bikes are a joy to ride...and a perfect example of Honda taking a great idea and making it even better.  Kirby's SuperSports 3901 S.
