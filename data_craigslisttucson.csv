The closest equivalent is the CrossCurrent X, which also has a rack for panniers and fenders. This bike had an upgrade of a frame with ""brushed aluminum"" finish, whereby only the frames with the highest quality welds and craftsmanship were selected, since the metal was given a clear finish.  It also has an upgraded 17.4 amp hour battery pack, which at 48 Volts can provide 835 Watt hours. Check out the photos and look for a chart showing your potential riding range based on your speed and this particular battery pack (Super Extended). I have primarily used the electric assist with a torque sensor, rather than cadence. This makes my peddling feel rather natural.  The harder you pedal, the more power it gives to the motor. If you pedal lighter, less power goes to the motor. It has different levels of electrical assist. The lowest level (Eco) is designed to just overcome the extra weight of the bike. Levels 1, 2 & 3 provide increasing assist up to 28 mph. Level S which stands for “Sport” continues to provide assist without any upper speed limit.  The weight of the bike is significant. Maybe about 54 pounds or a little more since I have the extended range battery. You must take that into account when braking. The bike is designed to support the extra weight with extra heavy duty spokes, frame, and hydraulic brakes. I like the idea that the battery pack is on the front down tube and not on the back wheel. This means that one can haul some loads with the bike rack — rated for 50 pounds. The total payload limit is 350 pounds.  I believe you will find the bike is very well thought out and designed and the craftsmanship is excellent. Customer support is pretty good as well. There was a little bit of assembly required when I received the bike. The headlamp/light they sent had some glue in one of the receptacles. The company quickly sent me a replacement. I also had a time or two when a fault signal appeared on the charging unit. Technical support readily resolved the issue by walking me through some simple steps.  I have an electronic copy of the instruction manual.  There are a few scratches on it when is the bike tipped over. All damage seems to be cosmetic. I had a slow leak in the rear tire and had a local bike shop replace the tube. It was a bit of a challenge for them to get the wheel off, but they managed.", Juiced Bikes, CrossCurrent S,, aluminum, hybrid/comfort," 16.5"" Medium", 27.5 in, disc (hydraulic), pedal assist, flat, suspension fork (hardtail),,,,

This bike can accommodate Riders from 5'3 to 5 ft 10 in and height. It's high tensile steel frame is extremely tough and durable yet surprisingly light and enables the bike to handle very well over all kinds of terrain. GT has a reputation for designing mountain bikes that transfer energy extremely well and are extremely easy to pedal and move around on. GT triple triangle frame design is well known throughout the bicycle industry as one of the most sound and effective bike frames ever produced everything on this bicycle is in excellent condition and ready to ride if you decide to purchase this bike you will need to do nothing to it for a long time to come! Some of the extra accessories include a bike rack on the back a bell to let people around you know you're there and a bottle cage for your favorite beverage it is powered by a Shimano drivetrain which lets you know that when you choose a gear to be in that's the gear you will find it has easy to operate twist shift shifters Promax v brakes front and back tires are in excellent condition and both rims spin freely and tru, the entire bike is in excellent shape.

This is a very fun bike to ride!

It also has a built-in cable lock to secure the bike(s) by locking the one in the outermost position.  I bought this rack brand new just a few months ago, and have only used it a few times.  I'm selling it because I recently got a new car on which this rack will not fit and I'm outside of the seller's return window, so this is a good opportunity for someone out there to get a great trunk rack, basically new, at a nice discount!  For product details, and to check if the rack will fit your car, please take a look at it on the Saris website at https://www.saris.com/product/superbones3  Feel free to send me an email if you're interested, and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I'm able.  Cash only, please.  I will not entertain low-ball offers, nor questions that have already been answered by the info provided in this listing.

PLEASE READ BEFORE ASKING QUESTIONS.  I think I’ve put some great details in here. Race car hauler, toy hauler, car trailer, camper  For sale is a 40’ enclosed triple axle car hauler. Goose neck hitch. Torsion bar suspension, Toy hauler. Has living area with bed, bathroom and kitchen.  I purchased this to move my household goods across country and then my truck broke. I ended up using a moving company so I no longer need this trailer. When I purchased it I found they only one of the six electric wheel brakes were working. I had to replace all six brake backing plates and components. This included all six wheel bearing sets and new seals with high end grease and proper torque‘s completed. Now this trailer stops quickly and safely. I have since fixed my truck and have pulled it to test drive it and check all of the friction for each one of the electric brakes. It handles perfectly on the road and has less than 35 miles on these brakes and bearings. The owner before me did a great job replacing the rubber flooring and adding new flooring in the kitchen as well as doing some painting and putting a brand new toilet in it. Toilet has a bidet wand and all works well. Mattress is very nice I believe it is a king mattress. Refrigerator works very well gets ice cold on 12 V, 110 V, or propane. Air conditioner runs really cold when I tested it. Has a toolbox mounted to the door and you can open the door so the toolbox ends up on the outside to do maintenance next to the trailer. I replaced both batteries. Has hydraulic jack in front to raise and lower tongue onto ball hitch. Requires bed mounted 2-5/16” gooseneck hitch setup. I have replaced all bulbs with LED bulbs, has work lights outside that are LED. Has a car stereo in it so you can listen to tunes while you work and has Bluetooth connection.   Distance between wheel wells on the inside is 76 1/4” (6’-4-1/4”) Rear Opening 75” tall x 92-1/2” wide opening of rear door 18’ to bathroom from rear door 72”x19”x19” fresh water tank. =88 gallons (estimated)  Very nice trailer could be used as a camper with your toys or as a professional racecar hauler, has a mount on the floor to position a winch to bring up vehicles that are not under their own power. There are tiedowns on the floors and walls, there is a couch that folds out into a bed as you can see in the pictures. It could easily sleep 3 to 4 people and you could put other beds in sleeping bags to sleep more if needed. I have videos of the water pump working in the toilet flushing that I can show you if needed. Has metal step and power cable for plugging in to power or connecting to generator. Does not have a generator included. Toy hauler camper Please reach out to me at 520 three-four-five 3045 ty, John   The ad is up, so it's still for sale.

When a more proficient V-Strom 1000 debuted in 2014, it was also embraced by riders around the world. To reemphasize the V-Strom’s leadership in this category, Suzuki applies new technology and practical experience to the new 2018 V-Strom 1000.Always a good citizen, this new V-Strom has refined systems to maintain engine performance and great fuel economy while achieving world-wide emission standards. To emphasize Suzuki’s adventure heritage the V-Strom’s exterior has undergone a transformation giving the motorcycle a hint of its lineage and a renewed call for adventure. That fresh styling also contributes to functionality and joins the new Motion Track Anti-lock* & Combined Brake System and other features to bring rider assist technology to a new group of adventure riders.Like every V-Strom before it, the appeal and value of the 2018 V-Strom 1000 will be recognized by experienced and enthusiastic riders. If you want to enjoy a trouble-free adventure as well, join them on a V-Strom.*Depending on road surface conditions, such as wet, loose, or uneven roads, braking distance for an ABS-equipped vehicle may be longer than for a vehicle not equipped with ABS. ABS cannot prevent wheel skidding caused by braking while cornering. Please drive carefully and do not overly rely on ABS.Features may include:Where the horizon ends, the adventure begins. Whether it’s a long-distance quest or a short-distance journey, the V-Strom is the versatile machine designed for the spirit of discovery.Liquid-cooled, 1037cc, 90-degree V-Twin engine delivers strong engine performance while achieving world-wide emissions requirements without any reduction in horsepower.A new, five-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) provides vehicle spacial information to the innovative Motion Track Anti-lock* & Combined Brake System.Refined multi-function, illumination-adjustable instrument panel delivers a wide range of vehicle information and aids in selecting the Suzuki Traction Control* system modes.ENGINEThe four-stroke, liquid-cooled, DOHC, 1037cc 90-degree V-twin engine is designed to deliver outstanding performance across the entire powerband.The perfect primary balance provided by the 90-degree L-twin design negates the need for any balancer shafts or rubber mounting as the engine has smooth power pulses.Pistons were engineered with use of FEM analysis to achieve ideal rigidity and weight.CHASSIS A bold new fairing design is achieved by a straight styling line from the tip of its beak back to the fuel tank. This is a sharp and aggressive refinement of the Suzuki DR-Big inspired appearance. The height- and angle-adjustable windscreen has a new shape and is 49mm taller. The windscreen was developed through extensive wind-tunnel testing to reduce wind noise and rider fatigue. Suzuki’s patented mechanism allows the windscreen angle to be easily adjusted by hand.The advanced chassis is the foundation of a compact, lightweight adventure-ready package that provides comfort and enjoyment to a variety of riders.

Here is a glimpse at just the top ten uses of utility trailers:  1.Automobiles: From time to time it becomes necessary to haul an inoperable car or truck. Tow trucks are expensive, especially if the distance is great. A utility trailer is a great way to haul vehicles and a good investment if you need to do so regularly.  2.Boats: If you have a boat, you will need a utility trailer to get it to and from the water.  3.Lawn Care Equipment: If you live in a rural area, you may find that you need to haul your mowing equipment from one piece of your property to another. Packing equipment and loading it into a pickup truck bed can get old very quickly. A utility trailer will allow you to drive your equipment right up onto the trailer without the aid of ramps or two strong men.  4.Furniture: Moving furniture is a breeze with a utility trailer. Furniture dollies roll right up onto the trailer and you can haul more than you can with a pickup.  5.Building Supplies: Do you have projects that need to be done around the house? Pick up your own building supplies and save on delivery fees.  6.Bikes, Motorcycles, and ATVs: Recreational vehicles are best hauled on a utility trailer.  7.Livestock: An enclosed utility trailer is most often used to haul livestock.  8.Auction and Flea Markets: If you frequent auctions and flea markets, you will need the hauling capability to bring home your inexpensive and rare finds.  9.Appliances: Utility trailers are ideal for hauling appliances.  10.Debris and Trash: Loading trash in and out of your pickup bed can be cumbersome and clean up can be messy, but it would be worse to have to haul trash in your SUV. Clean up after a big job is a lot easier with a utility trailer.  As you can see, there are many reasons why an investment in a utility trailer is a smart move. I'm sure that with a little time, and its easy availability, you will come up with even more ways to use a trailer  ATV UTV SXS MOTORCYCLE BIKE TRANSPORT HAUL MOVE CAR TRUCK MOVING TRAVELING STORAGE CARGO LOADS AUTHORITY BOAT HAULING BUSINESS BUSINESS FOR SALE JOB SALES CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT STEEL RAZOR SNOWMOBILE POLARIS YAHAMA WILD CAT MACHINE AUTOMOBILE AUTO VAN TOWING TOW VECHICLE SNOW RAIN BOX TRUCK FLATBED GOOSNECK BUMPER PULL HITCH BALL WEATHER BUY WOOD Westchester County, NY Amawalk, Annsville, Archville, Ardsley, Ardsley-on-Hudson, Armawalk, Armonk, Arthur Manor, Banksville, Bayberry Park, Bedford, Bedford Center, Bedford Hills, Beech Hill, Beechmont, Beechmont Woods, Bonnie Crest, Boutonville, Briarcliff Manor, Bronxville, Bronxville Heights, Bryn Mawr Park, Buchanan, Buckhout Corners, Butlerville, Cecil Park, Cedar Knolls, Chappaqua, Chauncey, Chester Hill Park, Chimney Corners, Colonial Acres, Colonial Heights, Crestwood, Crestwood Gardens, Crompond, Cross River, Croton Falls, Croton Heights, Croton-on-Hudson, Crotonville, Crugers, Dobbs Ferry, Dunwoodie, Dunwoodie Heights, East Irvington, East White Plains, East Woods, Eastchester, Eastview, Elmsford, Elmsmere, Fairview, Fleetwood, Forest Knolls, Fox Meadow, Furnace Woods, Gallows Hill, Glendale, Glenville, Glenwood, Goldens Bridge, Graham, Granite Springs, Grant Corner, Greenhaven, Greenville, Grey Oaks, Greystone, Gunther Park, Harrison, Hartsdale, Hastings-on-Hudson, Hawthorne, Heath Ridge, Heathcote, Heritage Hills, Homestead Park, Horseshoe Hill, Horton Estates, Huguenot Park, Irvington, Isle of San Souci, Jefferson Valley, Katonah, Kitchawan, Lake Katonah, Lake Lincolndale, Lake Mohegan, Lake Purdy, Larchmont, Lawrence Park, Lewisboro, Lincoln, Lincolndale, Lowerre, Ludlow, Mamaroneck, Maplewood, Mariandale, Millwood, Milton, Mohegan Heights, Mohegan Lake, Montrose, Mount Airy, Mount Hope, Mount Kisco, Mount Pleasant, Mount Vernon, Murdock Woods, Murray Hill, Nepera Park, Nepperhan, New Rochelle, North Salem, North White Plains, Oceola Lake, Orienta, Oscawana, Ossining, Park Hill, Parkside, Peekskill, Pelham, Pelham Manor, Philipse Manor, Pinebrook, Pinebrook Heights, Pleasantside, Pleasantville, Pocantico Hills, Port Chester, Pound Ridge, Purchase, Purdys, Purdys Grove, Quaker Ridge, Quarry Heights, Residence Park, Ridgeway, Rochelle Heights, Rochelle Park, Roe Park, Rosedale, Rye, Rye Brook, Salem Center, Sarles Corners, Scarborough, Scarsdale, Scarsdale Downs, Scarsdale Park, Scotts Corners, Secor Gardens, Shenorock, Sherman Park, Shore Acres, Shrub Oak, Sleepy Hollow, Sleepy Hollow Manor, Somers, South Salem, Sparta, Spring Valley, Stanwood, Sun Haven, Sunny Brae, Tarrytown, Thornwood, Toddville, Tompkins Corners, Tuckahoe, Twin Lakes Village, Valhalla, Valley Pond Estates, Van Cortlandtville, Vernon Park, Verplanck, Victory Park, Vista, Waccabuc, Waverly, West Mount Vernon, White Birches, White Plains, Whitehall Corners, Wilmot Woods, Windmill Farm, Woodlands, Woodybrook, Worthington, Wykagyl, Wykagyl Park, Yonkers, Yorktown, Yorktown Heights, brooklyn, queens, manhattan, nyc, bronx, staten island, long island, hudson valley",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether you’re carving through your favorite canyon or dominating the racetrack, it offers unparalleled performance. A compact, powerful 4-cylinder engine demonstrates the advanced race-proven technology of the GSX-R line when you hit the throttle and push it to redline, while supremely refined suspension systems front and rear help provide precise, responsive handling. Wrapped in aerodynamic and lightweight bodywork that’s lifted from the race track, the GSX-R600 can not only win races, it can win envy.Features may include:Built to own the racetrack and let loose on the streets. Since 1985, the GSX-R has been continuously refined to deliver new levels of performance and agility. This legacy of innovation continues with over 1 million legends made.Fuel-injected 599cc, 4-cylinder, engine delivers a rush of power from idle to redline.Suzuki Drive Mode Selector (S-DMS) lets the rider adjust the power delivery.Twin-spar aluminum frame and SHOWA big piston front fork deliver exceptional handling.Twin BREMBO Monobloc, radially mounted, front brakes deliver strong stopping power.Race-ready, iconic GSX-R styling provides sharp looks and a slippery shape.ENGINECompact 599cc 4-cylinder engine with a race-proven over-square bore/stroke ratio that produces remarkably strong high RPM power delivery.The energy efficient engine employs forged pistons, shot-peened connecting rods, chrome-nitride-coated upper compression and oil control rings, and pentagonal ventilation holes to reduce frictional and mechanical losses.Camshafts with aggressive valve-lift profiles were developed using proven MotoGP racing engine technology - the first time this method has been applied to a production Suzuki.Lightweight titanium-alloy valves are controlled by single coil valve springs to reduce valve train mass, reducing mechanical losses at high RPM.Lightweight and durable forged pistons were designed using the same Finite Element Method (FEM) and fatigue analysis technology used for MotoGP racing engines.Suzuki Dual Throttle Valve (SDTV) fuel injection uses eight, fine-spray 8-hole injectors for improved fuel atomization, which contributes to more complete combustion.CHASSISLightweight and compact twin-spar aluminum-alloy frame is constructed of five cast sections to produce a balance of light weight and strength.The frame is mated with a cast aluminum swingarm and multi-piece rear sub-frame that’s ready for race-track use.Race-developed, lightweight SHOWA Big Piston front Forks (BPF) deliver superb feedback and consistent performance.Single SHOWA rear shock features externally adjustable rebound and compression damping, along with adjustable ride height.Electronically controlled steering damper provides lighter steering at slower speeds and more damping force at racetrack and highway speeds.Front brakes with fully floating 310mm discs are grasped by radial-mount, four-piston BREMBO monobloc calipers.

The open road. And a week off. Does life get any better? Maybe—if that bike’s a Honda® Shadow® Interstate. With the Interstate you get the best of all worlds. For cruising or everyday riding, the Interstate has a clean, progressive style, plenty of motor and a look that’s going to make a big impression everywhere you ride. But add in a little vacation time and the Interstate is happy to stretch its legs and take you wherever you like, even if it’s a couple thousand miles away.The Interstate’s 1312cc V-twin engine generates plenty of low-end torque for relaxed urban rides, but is big enough for multi-day trips on long highways or over mountain passes. Shaft final drive gives you a clean, crisp look on the street, but its maintenance reducing features are exactly what you want a thousand miles from home too.Everywhere you look, the Interstate offers the details that set it apart: roomy floorboards, leather-clad saddlebags, custom windscreen. And best of all? A look nothing else can touch.Features may include:InnovationsWindscreenThe stylish custom windscreen keeps wind and weather at bay, ensuring both rider and passenger cruise in ultimate touring comfort.Chrome Fork CoversCustom bikes can never have too much style, as the Interstate illustrates perfectly with its brilliant, eye-catching chrome fork covers.Color-Matched FrameThe Interstate’s color-matched frame really gives this bike a finished, custom touch.Full-Size FloorboardsA must-have for every long-distance machine: large, roomy floorboards, with vibration-absorbing rubber inserts to keep your size-12 dogs relaxed all day long.Programmed Fuel Injection (PGM-FI)Forget about fiddling with a choke—the Interstate's fuel-injection system means no-hassle startups on cold mornings or at high altitudes, and optimal performance in any condition.1312cc V-Twin EnginePowerful 1312cc, 52-degree V-twin engine with a single-pin crankshaft and dual balancers has plenty of torque, and the feel only a V-twin can deliver.Heel-Toe ShifterA handy and old-school cruiser-style, heel-toe shifter is paired with the floorboards to make shifting through the gears a simple toe or heel tap away.Low-Slung SaddleMeasuring in at a low, easy-to-get-the-boots-down-when-stopping 26.7 inches, the Interstate’s wide, cushy seat not only enhances the comfort level, but the styling as well.Shaft Final DriveThe shaft final drive is quiet, clean and has been uniquely integrated into the overall design.Front- and Rear-Disc Brakes/ABSEquipped with powerful disc brakes at both ends, the Interstate is also available with Honda®'s Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) as an option.Hardcover SaddlebagsRoomy and built with stylish leather overlaying a protective hard case and cover, the Interstate's saddlebags are big enough to pack for a long trip—and durable enough to take it.
