We are also buying, selling and trading all manner of quality bicycle, but we are particularly focused on the brands we carry as new bikes like Surly, Salsa, All-City, Bianchi, Linus, SE, etc.  We are a bike store, have listed in the business section and paid the Craigslist fees accordingly.  We accept trade-ins.   All of our used and new bikes are warrantied. We warranty the used bikes ourselves for 60 days against everything including flat tires. The new bikes have the full factory warranty from manufacturer as we are authorized dealers.   You can see all the kids bikes that we currently have here - https://cocosvariety.com/collections/kids-bikes  Sign up for the Bike Alert! Email. We send whenever we have fresh inventory of new or used bikes.   +++++++++++++++++++++++++  Used woom 3 - Green - $350  Well kept and fully tuned by Coco's. Some scuffs and scraps, but very presentable for a kid learning to ride.   woom 3 - 16"" wheels - Ages  4 - 6  +++++++++++++++++++++++++  Used woom 3 - Red - $350  Well kept and fully tuned by Coco's. Some scuffs and scraps, but very presentable for a kid learning to ride.   woom 3 - 16"" wheels - Ages  4 - 6  We were a woom dealer and sold 100's of woom bicycles. When the demand skyrocketed during the pandemic, woom discontinued their small dealer network. We were the only dealer in Southern California. As such, we get a fair number of woom bikes as trade-ins.   +++++++++++++++++++++++++  Used Cleary Owl 20"" - Pink    Well kept, stored inside, little scratches here and there. Cleary is one of the premoer kid's bike manufacturers.  20"" New $430 (we have new Cleary Owls too) Used $350    +++++++++++++++++++++++++  Brand New Evo 24"" and 20"" Mountain Bikes   We have brand new Evo kid's bikes in stock in 20"" and 24"" sizes. Evo is a Euro brand thus the much lower level of graphics and such.  We like them as a lot of kid's bikes like these come with suspension forks which are generally not of high quality, not needed and weigh a lot more. In this configuration, you can ride some dirt, then later, if you are mostly road riding, change to a narrower slink tire.  24"" in mint (as seen) or black 20"" in red  Nice price for quality 7 speed bikes 24"" - $349 - 7 Speed  20"" - $299 - Single speed  +++++++++++++++++++++++++  New Cleary Bikes - Many colors, spec and sizes  We have 20 Cleary bikes in stock. At this time we only have new Clearys in sizes from 16"" -  26"". We believe that the Cleary is the best all around kids bike. The internal 3 and 5 speed hubs are so superior for kids than a derailleur that always get knock out of adjustment. The standard threadless stem set-up like on nice adult bikes means you can replace with longer stem as child ages and get another year or two out of the bike before outgrowing.

This is a little lower end than we usually sell - more of a Dick's Sporting Goods brand as opposed to a true bike store brand like Giant or Specialized. The bike is of fine quality but it is very heavy.   20"" wheel  Typically 6-9 years old, depending on the child. $100  +++++++++++++++++++++++++  Used Linus 16"" Roadster Blue with training wheels  Some scuffs and scraps but overall this bike is in nice condition. Less than half the price of new Linus 16""s which have reached an astonishing $369 for new ones.  16"" wheel Fits most riders ages 4 to 6 $160  +++++++++++++++++++++++++  Used Linus Lil Roadster in terrific condition. Blue with no training wheels  The most minor flaws distinguish it from a brand new bicycles.   20"" Wheel Typically 6-9 years old, depending on the child. $275   +++++++++++++++++++++++++  Giant Animator 16"" - Blue and White with training wheels  Clean condition!

It is a hard to find a kid's bike with the  features of an adult performance hybrid like narrow double wall rims, presta valves, threadless headset, dual pivot brakes, et al.

I am now applying my model and inventory to providing GREAT TEAM BUILDING EXPERIENCES and/or Corporate Events in SPIN CLASSES / RIDES - which include among the best spinning instructors in the industry!!!  In the physically and mentally fulfilling group exercise environment, all that is involved includes: staying in sync; keeping up with one another; going out on an adventure; relinquishing and trusting the lead of someone else; pulling out one's own 'best game' and pushing themselves beyond comfort boundaries; putting everyone on the same playing field; it's fun, energetic, gets endorphins kicking in... and, its centered around wellness (physically; mentally; spiritually)!   To the point - it got me thinking about exploring getting into the team-building / corporate event space... as I am in an opportune and great position to team up with organizations such as Best Corporate Events to offer spin classes (as I have the fleet of bikes; the access to the top instructors in the industry; can travel / deliver bikes around the US; and, have great ideas for this sort of activity that can be incorporated into your already successful and influential program(s)).    Nonetheless... I wanted to let you know I was out here now in this space and if this was something that you could incorporate into one of the several activities you incorporate into your program, I believe there's a lot that can be achieved with this activity for teams (of all sizes)!
