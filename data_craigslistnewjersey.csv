Chain length may vary +/- up to 2"". Professional operators choose Vulcan chain and lock kits to secure millions of pieces of valuable equipment every year — including trailers, motorcycles, bikes, and ATVs. Work with confidence, knowing that these chains and locks are backed by the 50 years of manufacturing expertise that only Vulcan can provide. NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFEAT OR CUT - The case hardened chain cannot be cut by hand with bolt cutters, and the lock includes a maximum security mechanism for ultimate protection. The square link shape of the chain does not allow bolt cutters to get a proper grip and the lock has been specially designed to be nearly impossible to grip with burglary tools. If you do not have the keys, you literally need an acetylene torch to defeat this chain and lock kit. HIGHEST QUALITY MATERIALS AND CONSTRUCTION - The solid forged brass one-piece body padlock has an exclusive shape and design that cannot be defeated with any normal burglary tools. The case hardened security chain is hardened to 63 rc at 10% depth and 50 rc in the core, making it impossible to cut with bolt cutters or any other hand tool. No other lock and chain kit on the market is made of stronger materials or has a more difficult design for criminals to defeat. ADDITIONAL PROTECTIVE FEATURES - The case hardened, square link security chain has an electro-galvanized finish for maximum corrosion protection, and it is fully covered in a cordura wear pad to protect against scratching on valuable tire rims, paint jobs, powder coating or other finishes.This anti theft kit works perfectly as a bike chain and bike lock, motorcycle chain and motorcycle lock, trailer chain and trailer lock, or ATV chain and ATV lock.",,,,,,,,,,
