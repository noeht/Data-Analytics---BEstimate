The rebuild included several modifications that are debatably factory due to the fact that I hunted and picked through the bone yard to pull the very best K0 camshaft, cam towers, rockers, shafts, etc. I pieced each together utilizing the best of each year of the 750 to maximize the power output ‚ÄúWITHOUT‚Äù increasing displacement. Essentially this bike has been gone through with power in mind, but I have not bored it out. Rather old parts have been replaced with either new stock sizes or lightly used parts. Everything and I mean EVERYTHING in the top end has been hand lightened, the head completely ported and polished, including combustion chambers, as well as domed (higher compression) pistons installed.  	‚ÅÉ	All electrical parts have been gone through with the points replaced, then essentially bypassed with a transistorized ignition, new coils, upgraded advance unit, modified advance springs, and so on. All in all everything is LED and the headlight alone is amazing to say the least. The electrical upgrades completely removed the 750 flat spot in the mid range and have overall reduced the workload that the wiring has to deal with. All of this improves reliability, performance, and safety.  	‚ÅÉ	The tires alone are over $500 in rubber and MAN do they hug the corners. 	‚ÅÉ	The suspension has been completely gone through, with fork seals and oil replaced. The triple tree clamps cracked on me on my way to work one day, so I bought a joker machine replacement set that are solid billet aluminum with taper steering stem bearings installed. 	‚ÅÉ	The front and rear wheels have been professionally trued and bearing have been replaced with the tires at end of last riding season.  	‚ÅÉ	The front wheels hub does not come stock setup to be able to receive a second (yes that‚Äôs right second, as in dual disk) disk, but I have machined the hub and have the second disk on the front wheel now. I also have the second brake setup complete, but you would just need to get the brake line for it. Cool part about the triple clamp is that it actually acts as the hydraulic splitter for the front end. So everything is set to go, I just never got around to getting it done.  	‚ÅÉ	There are two completely different set of pipes based on your preference. One is an after market 4 into 1 that is on it now. I personally don‚Äôt like or prefer this set, but haven‚Äôt had the time to swap them back to the original 4 into 4 chrome pipes. With all of the upgrades done to bike I thought it might do well with the 4 into 1 pipe, but honestly have been disappointed. The performance, sound, and look of the originals far out way the 4 into 1 set. Both come with the bike though.   I could go on and on about this bike if you couldn‚Äôt tell, but sadly a ‚Äúdeal with the devil‚Äù, just kidding a deal with my wife is causing me to have to give this prize up. Lame or stupid as I may sound I REALLY REALLY want this bike to go to someone who will love it the way that I have. Give it a good home if you will. The trick with ‚Äúold‚Äù bikes is that they need a certain amount of care and most people don‚Äôt get that. They just ride it and don‚Äôt take care of what they have. Really the only thing that hasn‚Äôt been updated in this bike is it‚Äôs cosmetics. The tank has a small ding and a scratch, but the seat, tank, and side panels are all from the 70‚Äôs. Quality stuff really.  I also have two full bins chalk full of parts for this baby. I am happy to include most of them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has a 60 volt, 1800 watt electrical system.  The batteries are each 16s2p (60 volt, 6 amp-hours) batteries, which are connected in parallel for greater capacity (60 volt, 12 amp-hours). I know the label on the batteries says they are 20000 mAh, but that's not true - just a fake value from the distributor.  The motor is a 48v, 1500w hub motor, which I have over-volted to 60v for greater top speed.  The top speed of the bike is about 25 mph, and the range is about 10 miles. Not a ton of range, but good for quick trips around town.  Feel free to reach out with any questions! I accept cash and Venmo - no trades. Text only, and I'm open to offers.  Thanks!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here is a glimpse at just the top ten uses of utility trailers:  1.Automobiles: From time to time it becomes necessary to haul an inoperable car or truck. Tow trucks are expensive, especially if the distance is great. A utility trailer is a great way to haul vehicles and a good investment if you need to do so regularly.  2.Boats: If you have a boat, you will need a utility trailer to get it to and from the water.  3.Lawn Care Equipment: If you live in a rural area, you may find that you need to haul your mowing equipment from one piece of your property to another. Packing equipment and loading it into a pickup truck bed can get old very quickly. A utility trailer will allow you to drive your equipment right up onto the trailer without the aid of ramps or two strong men.  4.Furniture: Moving furniture is a breeze with a utility trailer. Furniture dollies roll right up onto the trailer and you can haul more than you can with a pickup.  5.Building Supplies: Do you have projects that need to be done around the house? Pick up your own building supplies and save on delivery fees.  6.Bikes, Motorcycles, and ATVs: Recreational vehicles are best hauled on a utility trailer.  7.Livestock: An enclosed utility trailer is most often used to haul livestock.  8.Auction and Flea Markets: If you frequent auctions and flea markets, you will need the hauling capability to bring home your inexpensive and rare finds.  9.Appliances: Utility trailers are ideal for hauling appliances.  10.Debris and Trash: Loading trash in and out of your pickup bed can be cumbersome and clean up can be messy, but it would be worse to have to haul trash in your SUV. Clean up after a big job is a lot easier with a utility trailer.  As you can see, there are many reasons why an investment in a utility trailer is a smart move. I'm sure that with a little time, and its easy availability, you will come up with even more ways to use a trailer  ATV UTV SXS MOTORCYCLE BIKE TRANSPORT HAUL MOVE CAR TRUCK MOVING TRAVELING STORAGE CARGO LOADS AUTHORITY BOAT HAULING BUSINESS BUSINESS FOR SALE JOB SALES CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT STEEL RAZOR SNOWMOBILE POLARIS YAHAMA WILD CAT MACHINE AUTOMOBILE AUTO VAN TOWING TOW VECHICLE SNOW RAIN BOX TRUCK FLATBED GOOSNECK BUMPER PULL HITCH BALL WEATHER BUY WOOD Westchester County, NY Amawalk, Annsville, Archville, Ardsley, Ardsley-on-Hudson, Armawalk, Armonk, Arthur Manor, Banksville, Bayberry Park, Bedford, Bedford Center, Bedford Hills, Beech Hill, Beechmont, Beechmont Woods, Bonnie Crest, Boutonville, Briarcliff Manor, Bronxville, Bronxville Heights, Bryn Mawr Park, Buchanan, Buckhout Corners, Butlerville, Cecil Park, Cedar Knolls, Chappaqua, Chauncey, Chester Hill Park, Chimney Corners, Colonial Acres, Colonial Heights, Crestwood, Crestwood Gardens, Crompond, Cross River, Croton Falls, Croton Heights, Croton-on-Hudson, Crotonville, Crugers, Dobbs Ferry, Dunwoodie, Dunwoodie Heights, East Irvington, East White Plains, East Woods, Eastchester, Eastview, Elmsford, Elmsmere, Fairview, Fleetwood, Forest Knolls, Fox Meadow, Furnace Woods, Gallows Hill, Glendale, Glenville, Glenwood, Goldens Bridge, Graham, Granite Springs, Grant Corner, Greenhaven, Greenville, Grey Oaks, Greystone, Gunther Park, Harrison, Hartsdale, Hastings-on-Hudson, Hawthorne, Heath Ridge, Heathcote, Heritage Hills, Homestead Park, Horseshoe Hill, Horton Estates, Huguenot Park, Irvington, Isle of San Souci, Jefferson Valley, Katonah, Kitchawan, Lake Katonah, Lake Lincolndale, Lake Mohegan, Lake Purdy, Larchmont, Lawrence Park, Lewisboro, Lincoln, Lincolndale, Lowerre, Ludlow, Mamaroneck, Maplewood, Mariandale, Millwood, Milton, Mohegan Heights, Mohegan Lake, Montrose, Mount Airy, Mount Hope, Mount Kisco, Mount Pleasant, Mount Vernon, Murdock Woods, Murray Hill, Nepera Park, Nepperhan, New Rochelle, North Salem, North White Plains, Oceola Lake, Orienta, Oscawana, Ossining, Park Hill, Parkside, Peekskill, Pelham, Pelham Manor, Philipse Manor, Pinebrook, Pinebrook Heights, Pleasantside, Pleasantville, Pocantico Hills, Port Chester, Pound Ridge, Purchase, Purdys, Purdys Grove, Quaker Ridge, Quarry Heights, Residence Park, Ridgeway, Rochelle Heights, Rochelle Park, Roe Park, Rosedale, Rye, Rye Brook, Salem Center, Sarles Corners, Scarborough, Scarsdale, Scarsdale Downs, Scarsdale Park, Scotts Corners, Secor Gardens, Shenorock, Sherman Park, Shore Acres, Shrub Oak, Sleepy Hollow, Sleepy Hollow Manor, Somers, South Salem, Sparta, Spring Valley, Stanwood, Sun Haven, Sunny Brae, Tarrytown, Thornwood, Toddville, Tompkins Corners, Tuckahoe, Twin Lakes Village, Valhalla, Valley Pond Estates, Van Cortlandtville, Vernon Park, Verplanck, Victory Park, Vista, Waccabuc, Waverly, West Mount Vernon, White Birches, White Plains, Whitehall Corners, Wilmot Woods, Windmill Farm, Woodlands, Woodybrook, Worthington, Wykagyl, Wykagyl Park, Yonkers, Yorktown, Yorktown Heights, brooklyn, queens, manhattan, nyc, bronx, staten island, long island, hudson valley",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Selling my 2019 Specialized S-WORKS Stumpjumper custom complete build. What can I say... I have absolutely loved this bike over the past couple of years. To me, with the amount of travel and geo this bike has, it makes for a perfect ""do everything, enjoy everything"" bike. From DH lift serve, to good and rugged trail riding, or to fun XC races, this bike is truly a go-to.  I've ridden the Stumpjumper line for a number of years now and am only selling because I ponied up and bought one of the new ones...  Please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions about the bike or if you'd like any additional photos. Happy to meet up if you are in the SLC area. Would ship within the U.S. only. Cash is king, but would consider Venmo/PayPal.  It goes without saying that this bike has your normal wear and tear (scratches and such + chipped brake lever reservoir that's 100% functional), but there are no known dents, cracks, or other critical damage to the frame or components.  I've given the bike a good once over to ensure it is as amazing for your first ride as it will be for your entire next season:  -Washed and wiped down -Brake pads and rotors cleaned with rubbing alcohol (still have good life) -Fresh sealant in front and rear tires -Derailleur cable is relatively new (~7 rides) -Cleaned and regreased headset (still feeling nice and smooth), axles, and rear cassette / freehub  SPECS:  Frame: 2019 S-WORKS Stumpjumper, 150mm travel, Large, 650B/27.5"", Gloss/Sunset Acid Kiwi. Threaded BB (hallelujah), SWAT storage in downtube, chain silencer, and flip chip adjustable BB height setting. Also comes with a side loading bottle cage that has a built in multitool, and a spare tube and sleeve for the SWAT downtube storage.  Rear Shock: Fox Float DPX2 Factory  Fork: Fox Factory 36 with blue, thick vinyl Slik Graphics  Wheels: Custom built - Spank Spike 33 Race Aluminum Rims + I9 Torch Hubs (120 points of engagement), DT Swiss spokes, and Shimano 6B Ice Tech Rotors (203mm Front & 180mm Rear).

40362,125000.0,saltlakecity,https://saltlakecity.craigslist.org/snw/d/salt-lake-city-class-10-race-car-kreger/7458371091.html,2022-03-23 10:05,Class 10 Race Car (Kreger Fabrication),,24,"Kreger Fabrication Class 10 Race Car for Sale  What we have here is a race car that was so far ahead of its time in 2012 that even the best Class 10 race car fabricators are yet to matchup in 2022.  This incredible Class 10 race car has all the goodies on it. I purchased it as a used car in 2016, and even though it was Fabricated in 2012 the car sat in the original owners garage, was never raced once, and the only miles it had on it at the time was the original shake down after the 2012 fabrication. 2016 was the first time this car ever raced, and I raced it in the 2016 Baja 1000. We all know that a good race car is a good race car forever and age is often irrelevant, as long as it carries the latest and greatest racing technology, which it has, and I‚Äôll list anything and everything you will want to know below‚Ä¶ so please read the entire add, and look through all the pictured before you call about that car.  Everyone seems to know what a Kreger Car is, and everyone always says a Kreger Car is one of the best made race cars money can buy. As such, Kreger Cars are widely known to be one of the top class 1 and Class 10 brands in the desert. Whenever there are Kreger cars racing you constantly see them all in the top 5 of a race, if not in the top 3. This is impressive and says a lot about the car as there aren‚Äôt a ton of them out there, and there are even less that are actually racing. Last time we raced a full season was in 2018, and 2 Kreger Cars were in the top 3 for the Points that year‚Ä¶ My Kreger and Peter Hajas Kreger car.   I own a couple Kreger Cars. I‚Äôm selling this car because I have purchased a Kreger Class 1 car that my team will be racing instead of class 10. I‚Äôd love to keep her sitting in the shop, but alas, its just too much to worry about and I need the money to dump into my new class program. Kreger cars are hands down the lightest Class 10 race car in the desert. None other can even come close to a Kreger when it comes to weight, which is incredibly important to a Class 10 race car. On top of being light they are tough as nails! Just get into the rough stuff and watch, you will catch everyone. Those of us who own Kreger cars always say ‚ÄúThe Rougher the better‚Äù.  Kreger Fabrications designs are just incredible and so well thought out, and the quality of workmanship is apparent, you can see that those who built the car, mostly Derek Kreger himself, take great pride in every weld, but and bolt.  Once you have been racing a while you tend to not care as much about how sexy our race cars looks, or the lines they exhibit‚Ä¶ Love it or hate it‚Ä¶ the Kreger Car is the best looking Race Buggy in the desert. I remember I was in Baja Racing bikes and I came across John Walkers Class 1 race car down there. I couldn‚Äôt get it out of my head, so when I started looking to get into 4 wheel racing, the Kreger was the first car I thought about. The lines and look of the car were the original reason I even called Derek Kreger for the first time, I just really liked how Kreger Cars look. I have also driven many different brands, many of which are amazing cars‚Ä¶ but the Kreger Car is the one I always settled on. In the pictures you will see a couple pictures with the panels on the car. These panels are incredible, and can be removed in 1 minute flat, by yourself. If your team is a proficient team, they can have the cars panels completely removed in less than 15 seconds, this includes the roof, hood, side panels, engine panels, and so on. Its just so well thought out its unbelievable.  Any chips or damage you see on the panels will be completely repaired by the time you see this ad. I‚Äôm having the panels stripped and sanded and resurfaced so they look like they are a high gloss white paint. So, they will be near perfect if you happen to come look the car over. BTW, the panels are so light, but some prefer not to have them, mostly to help loose a bit more weight, but honestly they are really light.  As for what equipment the car has, please go through the detailed list below for a comprehensive list of the cars equipment. There are likely a few items that could be updated to help make the car even faster.   1.	Fully Prepped- Kreger Race Support completed a full prep. There is only 100 miles on the prep, including Shake Down miles. I call it a Level 2 Race Prep. All CV‚Äôs replaced, Heim‚Äôs Replaced, Bushings replaced, Shocks rebuilt, HUB bearings replaced or repacked, Transmission fully prepped, Engine taken out and all fluids replaced, Clutch Replaced, Wheels aligned, and fully washed down. I know there is way more to it than that, but the car drives like new every time Kreger Preps the car, as it should.  2.	Kreger Tube Frame- Class 10 Race car frame (Score tagged, and BITD Legal and ready to race) 3.	Kreger Arms- Kreger Class 10 Trailing ARMs and A-Arms. These arms arnt brand new, but are in good condition and have A LOT of life left in them. 4.	Kreger HUBS - Kreger HUBs are incredible and are the only hubs that allow the Axle to be replaced without taking the wheel off.  5.	Kreger Design-  The incredible design of the Kreger Hubs, boots, and Arms allow this car to have a Whopping 24 inches of Travel on all 4 corners of the car. Very few class 10 cars to this day have a full 24 inches of travel up front and in the rear.  6.	King Shocks- 3.0 Triple Bypass on all 4 corners.  a.	I have seen so many cars over the years pulled over due to their shocks overheating. We are a top class 10 team and haven‚Äôt ever had this issue. I‚Äôm not sure why, or if its due to my driving style, or the car doing a better job at cooling the reservoirs.  b.	One item I do think would make this car faster is bigger 3.5 Shocks in the front and rear. There is a tradeoff in weight‚Ä¶ but I would personally like to try it. The problem for me is I have never had an issue with the handling of the car, as its tuned great for me, and we do make small adjustment depending on the race, but its hard to spend 25 grand on new 3.5 shocks to see if they are better or not. I believe the only difference you may ever see is the very bottom end of hard hits to the shocks, which don‚Äôt happen all the time anyways.   7.	King Shocks- 3.0 Spring custom built for a Kreger Car.  8.	Engine- The engine is the latest and greatest in Class 10.  a.	Wiks Direct Injection Ecotec tuned and tagged by Wiks himself. I have 600 documentable race miles on this engine. I can prove it if needed. This engine is just getting broken in at 600 miles.  b.	I know Ecotec engines stay pretty cool anyways, but there are some races that are really hard on even an Ecotec, I have seen plenty other class 10 cars pulled over due to overheating. This car will NEVER overheat. The radiator is directly in the path of air on this car, and it‚Äôs a deep radiator, and Kreger also fabricated a system that can handle 2 liters of extra coolant that the engine can call on if needed.  9.	Transmission- Fortin Sequential 6 speed (No lift Shift) Transmission with 100 documentable miles on the rebuild of the tranny. (Maintained by Daniel Folts).  This Tranny is widely known as the best transmission a Class 10 race car can have. I have NEVER has 1 issue with this tranny. Its bullet Proof and Amazing. 10.	CV‚Äôs & Axles- 934 CV‚Äôs‚Ä¶ The big ones. Never break an axle, ever!  The CV‚Äôs are also the highest quality steel CV‚Äôs money can buy.  11.	ECU- Motec Engine Computer that is fully programmable. I had the life computer, but it was junk compared to this computer, but Motec comes at a cost. 12.	Dash Display- Motec Dash display that has all the goodies and is completely programmed with all buttons and panels on the dash. The Motec Control unit controls all lighting, fuel pumps, etc‚Ä¶ at the touch of a button. The motec display also has everything on display and allows you to scroll through all engine info such as LAMBDA, RPM, etc.  It can be programmed to tell you when to shift, and can also monitor tire PSI, and will also let you know when something is out of wack.  13.	Fuel- The Motec is programmed to use Sonoco E-85 race fuel, and I‚Äôm pretty sure it can also sense when non-E-85 fuel is being used and the Motec ECU will automatically switch programs‚Ä¶ I have to double check on this, but we never have anything in the car except E85, so I honestly cant remember.  Could probably gain some speed by using a higher E rated fuel.. like E96 if one wanted.  14.	Fuel Tank- 35 Gallon Race Legal fuel tank. Replaced approx. 2 years ago. We replaced it to get a few more gallons in the car.  15.	Speed Limiter- Speed Limited adjustable Switch and knob (never get hit for speeding in the pits again). 3 Settings‚Ä¶ 25 MPH, 28 MPH, and 60 MPH.  16.	Fuel System- 2 High grade fuel pumps‚Ä¶ Pump A is the main Pump, and pump B is the backup pump. The fuel pumps are independently controlled by the Motec Dash.  All Fuel Lines are Steel Braided Teflon lined hoses, all professionally cut and mounted to terminate with special race grade, and good looking, Aluminum fittings. Making it sooo easy to swap parts in and out. The Teflon hosing lasts much longer than the normal tubing as E-85 fuel is tough on rubber and plastics.  a.	Another way I believe some speed can be gained is by tuning the engine to use E-96 race fuel. It won‚Äôt add much, but it will give an edge with a light car like this, especially on shorter style race courses.  17.	Wheels & Tires- Tire Pressure Monitoring System. Huge advantage when racing. Honestly, we haven‚Äôt really needed to use it with the new BFG kR3 tires we have been using.  a.	Car to come with 10 Brand New 35-inch BFG KR3 Tires will come with the car.  b.	I will also send a bunch of used tires that are still very much good which we use as spares and front tires very often. c.	OMF Wheels- I had OMF Custom Make 10 Forged and Machined Aluminum Wheels. Believe it or not we saved 4 to 5 pounds of rotating mass, on each corner, when compared to Method wheels, we had been running before. These Wheels are 5.5 inches wide and I can‚Äôt recall the offset.  d.	The OMF wheels are also modular, which means if one side bends or breaks you can replace it. They have been incredible for us on this car and we instantly noticed the car was faster with them. e.	I‚Äôm very loyal to BFG‚Ä¶ however, I do believe the tensor tires would add some speed and HP to the ground over the BFG tires‚Ä¶ but again, there is always a tradeoff. The Tensor tires are amazing, and fast, but they go flat far more often than the BFG KR3 tires. I had a seasons were we didn‚Äôt even get a flat tire during the race, and that‚Äôs incredible. It shows how good BFG is at what they do, and these KR3 tires also handle incredible.  18.	Steering-  We use a Howe Steering Rack which was also replaced last year, but only because I had another car that needed a new steering rack, so I gave it to this car and took the old one off to put it on the other car. I only put the best on this car. a.	MOMO Suede Steering Wheel. b.	Extra Steering Pump stowed behind the driver‚Äôs right side of the seat and it will remain with the car.  c.	Tie Rods are 1-inch Chromoly steel, and are also powder coated to match the Arms. I have never bent a tie rod on this car as they are incredibly strong.  i.	I have a spare Tie Rod, and used to carry it on the car until I found they never have issues.  d.	I have literally never had a steering issue on this car. It can pound through the roughest terrain you can think of and you will be driving with 1 finger if you want.  e.	Extra Large Power Steering Fluid Reservoir.   19.	Electrical System-  The wiring/electrical of Kreger cars is one of the items that has always separated them from the rest.  a.	Kreger has a wiring harness built for all its race cars. This harness fits the car perfect. All wires to the engine, in the dash, to the batteries, and so on are all the perfect measurement and spliced and shrunk wrapped to look down right pretty.  b.	Cannon Cable Plugs are placed at all Major Terminations of the wiring, like at the engine, dash, lights, and so on. To remove the Dash you simply twist the cannon plug and unplug it, and then pull the dash off! The same goes for the Engine, Light bar, and coms system. Its perfect.  c.	 Extra 1 wire Alternator stowed under the hood of the car will also come with the car.  20.	Communications- Once again, this car has pretty much the best (Except for a satellite radio system) that money can buy.  a.	110 Watt Kenwood in the dash radio. This thing is incredible, it can handle most race courses.  b.	PCI Trax Intercom for the Driver & Copilot. This system has a driver isolate button as well as an incredible sound filter that helps block out anything but voice. Last of all it is Bluetooth compatible, so you can pump in some tunes during the race.  c.	No Ground Plane antenna.. This is only 12 inches tall, and its incredible. Custom cut for this race car so it gets perfect reception.  21.	On Board Storage- Hostile Bags are the primary way you can store parts, tools, food, water and First Aid items.  Not pictured‚Ä¶ but I will send all the custom made Hostile Bags.  They are specifically made to fit in between the tubes of the cars frame. The tool bag sits below the co-pilots feet.  a.	The Car has a nifty way of stowing an emergency breaker bar.  On the right of the co-pilot, and its not pictured. 22.	Safety ‚Äì This car is race ready, and should pass any Tech Inspection. It has the following safety items.  a.	New Parker Pumper- We just had our pumper give up the ghost, so we just replaced it and its filer.  b.	Impact 5 Point seat belt Harness.  c.	Sun Visor. d.	Mastercraft window netting. e.	Mastercraft Suspension seats.   f.	Lowrance GPS- Touch and Split Screen. g.	First Aid Kit. h.	Race Rated Kevlar Fuel Cell. i.	Anti-Spill Ball Valve on fuel tank if you find yourself upside down.  j.	1 of all major spare parts. k.	Stop Lights, Running Lights and Rear Amber Flashing Light Bar. l.	Triangles for being stopped.  m.	I finally took the time to find a horn that people can hear‚Ä¶ well, its works better, but not perfect. 23.	Lighting-  This car has the ability to control all lighting separate via the motec dash control unit. Just the touch of a button, and the best part is the Motec Dash control unit is completely programmable.  a.	Baja Designs LP 9 Amber Front Lights.  Since I have had these I haven‚Äôt had much need for the light bar, unless it‚Äôs a true night race.  b.	Baja Designs built in hood lights. These are programmed to flash back and forth to better help your crew identify when you are coming in to pit‚Ä¶ or if you are down for mechanical repairs. c.	Baja Designs quick mount light bar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Did it succeed? Or was it just trying to please all the people all the time? Around 1980, the full-size motorcycle market began splintering into numerous niches, including the Factory Custom. Seats grew steps, bars pulled back, footpegs inched forward, and clean drive shafts replaced messy chains. No doubt mindful that its game-changing V4s were in the pipeline, Honda stretched its trusty 4-valve inline 750cc to 900cc, then laid back its ergonomics to take on Suzuki‚Äôs cruiser GS850/1100GL and Yamaha‚Äôs similarly-themed XS1100 Special. Essentially, Honda hijacked the engine from its Euro-spec CB900F to power the CB900C. The air-cooled, 16-valve double overhead cam with pent-roof combustion chambers was fed by four 32mm Keihin carburetors. A single-piece forged crankshaft drove a jackshaft via a Hy-Vo chain, with gear drive from the jackshaft to the clutch and 5-speed tranny. Shaft drive was de rigueur in the custom class, so to keep development costs down Honda borrowed the final drive unit from the GL1100 to use on the 900C. There was, however, one minor problem using the GL unit: the CB900‚Äôs tranny output was on the bike‚Äôs left side, and the GL1100‚Äôs shaft was on the right. Honda‚Äôs solution was a crossover shaft ‚Äî actually, two shafts incorporating two pairs of gears. This gave the CB900C a 2-speed ‚ÄúSelect Range‚Äù secondary transmission sitting in its own transfer case, complete with its own trochoidal oil pump for lubrication. And while it wasn‚Äôt as complicated as it sounds, it wasn‚Äôt exactly simple.¬†Cycle¬†magazine counted ‚Äú20 gears, six shafts, a dozen bearings, three torque cushions, a U-joint and assorted couplings employed in making the crank/rear wheel connection.‚Äù The 2-speed transfer case meant 10 forward gears, giving CB900C riders incredible flexibility in gearing. It also went a long way toward the bike‚Äôs reasonable fuel economy. Kept in ‚Äúhigh‚Äù range, reports of 50mpg were common. That said, left in ‚Äúlow‚Äù range and ridden with a heavy right hand the CB900C would return as little as 30mpg. Yet the multitude of driveline components allowed generous driveline lash, which, combined with lean EPA-mandated carburetion, made for herky-jerky throttle transitions ‚Äúthe like of which you won‚Äôt find in any other motorcycle presently in production,‚Äù¬†Cycle¬†said. The extra transmission case also stretched the frame, and thus lengthened the wheelbase to a Harley-esque 62 inches ‚Äî even using a short swingarm. This latter item introduced its own problems, causing noticeable torque jacking under acceleration and a lack of rear end traction under braking, chirping the rear tire. And the C-bike weighed in at nearly 590 pounds ready to ride, making it just about the heaviest machine in its class. In most other respects, though, the 900C worked really well. Testers praised its electric-motor-like power delivery; lack of vibration (the engine was rubber-mounted); straight-line performance (less than 12.5 seconds at almost 110mph in the quarter mile ‚Äî on¬† par with the XS11 and GS11); adjustable air-assisted suspension (also derived from the GL1100); and even its handling ‚Äî in spite of a lazy 29-degree steering angle and squirmy 16-inch rear tire. Comfort was good (though the stepped seat trapped the rider in one position), brakes powerful and resistant to fade, and the 2-speed tranny reduced engine speed by a useful 500rpm at highway cruising speeds ‚Äî and fuel consumption by as much as 16 percent if left in high. Even so,¬†Cycle Guide¬†concluded the extra five gears ‚Äúbordered on the redundant‚Äù and a similar result ‚Äúcould easily have been accomplished with a 6-speed transmission.‚Äù Built to Honda‚Äôs typically high standards, CB900Cs could pile on the miles. The 2-speed transfer case doesn‚Äôt appear to have any negative impact on reliability, and like other Honda fours the 900C had few major problem areas. But what really baffled testers was how to classify the CB900C. Was it a cruiser, a tourer or a new type of sport bike? Though intended to appeal to American buyers, the custom styling left¬†Cycle Guide¬†testers cold. One called it the ‚ÄúKing Kong Kompromise Kruiser,‚Äù while another considered it a dinosaur and hoped its inevitable extinction would ‚Äúmark a return to a more sensible line of motorcycles where sheer size is not a prime factor.‚Äù A third thought it had been ‚Äúdressed by committee.‚Äù Ultimately, it was a bike in search of a market, and while briefly popular, it was dropped after just three years in Honda‚Äôs lineup. It‚Äôs perhaps ironic to note that the CB900C, a decidedly large bike when introduced, looks like a featherweight alongside today‚Äôs gargantuan boulevard bikes. Maybe it was just 30 years ahead of its time.WE BUY CARS AND CONSIGN CARSMORE PICTURES and VIDEO CLIPS ON OUR WEBSITE: www.DesertPrivateCollection.comWE BUY CLASSIC CARS - CONSIGN and SELL -¬†PHOTO SHOOT RENTAL IS AVAILABLECalifornia buyers must pay CA sales tax , all prices in USD .¬† Disclaimer-Finance Requirements listed at our website-Price does not include sales tax and DMV registration feesMonthly payment is based on approved Credit for more Inventory VISIT OUR WEBSITE¬†https://www.desertprivatecollection.com/ or call¬†(760) 313-6607FOR CONSIGNMENT PLEASE CONTACT¬†US¬†(760) 313-6607This head turning 1980 Honda CR 900 Standard fits your budget at $2,750.

At the front wheel, a radially-mounted, four-piston, fixed brake caliper bites onto a floating 320 mm disc. Thanks to a forgiving setup of the two-channel ABS, the huge potential of these brakes can always be fully utilized. CHASSIS - CHASSIS: The 9 kg tubular trellis frame made from chrome-molybdenum steel and the equally lightweight, smoking hot swingarm, die-cast in aluminum, impress with extreme levels of torsional stiffness, providing the 148.5 kg Duke with excellent tracking stability and a continuous flow of information to the rider. Triple clamps lower the fork offset, which underlines this characteristic even further. You‚Äôll notice.  ENGINE & EXHAUST - ENGINE: From the trademark 690 cm¬≥ thumper, the engineers have extracted a whopping 73 hp (54 kW) and 74 Nm of torque, making light work of the equally lightweight 690 Duke. How it happened? They completely reworked the cylinder head, inserted an ultra light and extremely strong piston and connection rod, rerouted the air intake through a resonator chamber and provided the crankshaft with sleeve bearings. As a result, the powerband is a thousand rpm wider, which means an even more uniform power delivery, especially in the mid to high rev range. Twin ignition featuring plug-selective mapping, rock solid but featherweight internals and optimized intake and exhaust systems cultivate this massive mono to be as strong as it is smooth, assisted by an advanced ride-by-wire system, which guarantees great refinement as well as low fuel consumption and emission figures. You‚Äôre green, while they‚Äôre green with envy. And you haven‚Äôt even begun mentioning upmarket goodies like a standard slipper clutch.  ENGINE MANAGEMENT: The electronic engine management system lives to make the LC4 shine. Twin ignition with individual mappings for each spark plug ensures that your precious fuel is always burned to perfection, irrespective of load and engine speed. And then there is genuine ride-by-wire, in other words: Electronically controlled throttle valve actuation without any mechanical linkage. You‚Äôd be forgiven for thinking it runs on cream. Whipped cream, that is. EXHAUST: Thanks to its optimized intake and exhaust system, the LC4 engine even complies with the Euro IV emission control standards. A first in KTM‚Äôs history. MASS CENTRALIZATION: The Duke does not only impress with its low weight and perfect chassis geometry; the centralization of weight - for example, by positioning the brushed stainless steel pre-silencer under the engine - also contributes to its playful handling and razor-sharp precision. ERGONOMICS & COMFORT - ERGONOMICS & COMFORT: Despite its pronounced lust for cornering, the 690 Duke also presents versatile real-world capabilities. On a daily basis, particularly the two-piece seat will prove a valuable friend. It‚Äôs comfortable and spacious, while still being set up for all dynamic riding situations. The seating position and freedom of movement behind the wide aluminum handlebar provide perfect support for controlling the bike both in traffic hell as well as cornering heaven. Workday commute or weekend blast: the 690 Duke has your back.  SOFTWARE & ELECTRONICS - ABS: The dual-circuit ABS system with 9M+ modulator, fine-tuned in cooperation with Bosch, offers total protection against over-braking, while maintaining the full effect and glorious feedback of a genuine sports brake thanks to hypersensitive sensors. This ABS system, weighing no more than one kilogram, therefore allows extremely sporty braking, while actively preventing loop-outs. And just so you know: It‚Äôs disengageable. So stoppies are still allowed.  WHEELS & SUSPENSION - SUSPENSION: The upside-down fork on the Duke (with a 43 mm diameter) and pivot-arm articulated pressurized-gas monoshock, both by WP, excel with flawless tuning and a broad spectrum of use for all demands, from relaxed cruising to hammering around on closed circuits. The options are limitless, and so is your lean angle.  Please call as fees and taxes do apply  Blackfootmotorsportsinc.com  2087821981  1615 W Bridge  Blackfootmotorsportsinc.com",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Built them ourselves from the OC kit. I've done all the hard work, now you can just ride!  Great for when you don't want/can't get to the skate park.  With the pair can set them side by side for wider 6ft wide quarter-pipe, or facing for more of a half-pipe, or even back-to-back to go up over and down other side.  Always stored in garage, never exposed to weather. normal wear, fully funtional and very sturdy.  We bought the Skate Paint but never applied, costs over $100 for the gallon that is enough to treat both ramps. I'll throw that in for free.  These go for $780 new for the pair + $110 gallon of Skate Paint, plus they're already built for you that's $900 value only asking $500.",,,,, OC Ramps, quarter-pipe ramp,,,,,, 3ft wide,,,
