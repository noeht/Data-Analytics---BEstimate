The 2022 GSX-R750 continues Suzuki’s tradition of building Supersport bikes powered by a strong engine carried in a lightweight and nimble chassis. On the road or on the track, the GSX-R750 delivers a breathtaking combination of outstanding engine performance, crisp handling, compact size, and light weight. Its secret is an unequaled pairing of 750cc performance with the lightweight, compact chassis of a 600cc Supersport, complemented by technologically advanced suspension front and rear.

The new 25th anniversary CBR®1000RR is a Superbike where the rider comes first. Where you get a degree of connection unlike anything in the class. Available in three distinct model options this year, it’s designed to dominate in the most important category of all: rider satisfaction.The all-new 2017 CBR®1000RR is lighter, more powerful and faster than any CBR®1000RR we’ve ever produced. Trackdays your specialty? Racetrack riding puts special demands on any machine, and you’ll find Honda’s new CBR®1000RR SP is up to that challenge. Available in limited numbers, it has all the features of our new 2017 CBR®1000RR, but adds premium Öhlins electronic suspension, Brembo brakes, a titanium muffler, and more. In addition to the SP, Honda is offering an even more exotic CBR®1000RR SP2 in extremely limited numbers for the most serious enthusiasts and professional racers. The CBR®1000RR SP2 incorporates all the special features of the CBR®1000RR SP, and adds bigger intake and exhaust valves and lighter forged Marchesini wheels.Features may include:The new 2017 CBR®1000RR is substantially lighter, more than 24mm narrower, features our first Superbike throttle-by-wire system and more. The chassis is more responsive, and the bike features a full LED lighting package.PERFORMANCEThrottle By WireThe CBR®1000RR's new throttle-by-wire system works in concert with our Honda Selectable Torque Control. With the two, you get your choice of three engine power-delivery modes, plus two which you can custom program yourself.All-new Four-Cylinder EngineFeaturing high-compression 13:1 pistons, the new CBR®1000RR revs like only a flat-plane inline-four can. It also makes ten horsepower more than our previous CBR®1000RR.Brembo Monobloc Front CalipersThe CBR®1000RR SP’s race-proven, radial-mount Brembo monobloc calipers are light, but they provide exceptional stiffness and excellent braking performance.HANDLINGNew Öhlins Smart EC SuspensionThe CBR®1000RR SP and SP2 feature a new Öhlins Smart electronic control suspension system. It comes with three pre-set suspension modes, plus two “blank” user-programmable modes. It’s fully adjustable, semi-active, truly premium and track-ready — a huge upgrade from what you’d normally find on a streetbike.New Gyro-Assisted ABSEvery new CBR®1000RR SP and SP2 comes with anti-lock brakes, and they’re available on the standard CBR®1000RR as an option. But these brakes go one better, including rear-wheel lift analysis (think hard stopping here), along with a program that takes lean angle into account.Slimmer ErgonomicsThe new CBR®1000RRs are much slimmer in the tank/seat junction area, and also in the upper cowl (more than 24mm trimmer). This improves aerodynamics, and the narrow tank makes it easier to tuck in.ENGINEERINGAssisted Slipper ClutchSuperbikes can deliver a great deal of back-torque through the driveline, upsetting handling—not the CBR®1000RR models. Its Honda-designed assisted slipper clutch is the same type used on our MotoGP bikes. The design does away with the need for heavy clutch springs, ensuring full power transmission with smooth shifting and a light clutch pull at the lever.Titanium MufflerMotoGP bikes use titanium for their mufflers, and so do the new CBR®1000RR SP and SP2. It’s a significant weight savings.Wheels in Motion9710 De Soto AveChatsworth, CA 91311Ask for: Sales TeamPrimary Phone: (866) 842-7080Text with any questions 747-205-4007 WE WILL NOT BE UNDERSOLD.

Happy to answer questions.  Gorgeous red (like new, albeit a little dusty) Cannondale Caad9 Cyclocross (Cross) Road and Gravel bike for sale.  This has been my backup bike and has probably seen all of 300 miles of paved road use since I bought it new.  I only ride on the road and just bought another bike...  Like all Cannondales, this one handles very well and has a stiff bottom bracket for efficient climbing.  The longer chainstays on these cross bikes (not to mention the slightly fatter tires) makes for a cadillac ride on bumpy roads.  But the geometry is agile enough for fast handling.  The frame matches a 58cm road frame.  I am exactly 6' tall and I suspect this fits the range of 5-8"" to 6-2"" in height, definitely a large bike.  The tires have probably 50 miles of pavement-only use on them--I tried these in Solvang a couple of times.  This is also a great bike for the trainer or Zwift.  Made in the USA Aluminum frame.... remember those days? Framesize:  56cm Cyclocross bike matches 58cm (SuperSix) road bike.

Pedals: Temporary crap platform pedals.... just for testing.  Condition:  No dings/scratches... fantastic shape really.  Bicycling is dangerous, my lawyer recommends that you have a reputable bike shop check and tune this bike before riding.  Everything looks and functions perfectly fine to me, but please swap out the temporary pedals before you ride.  Yes, I still have it.  Will remove this advert when it sells. Cash and carry only please, no checks of any kind. I will be happy to meet you in a public place so you can check the bike.  Please include a Tel # if you contact me. Thank you for looking.",,,
