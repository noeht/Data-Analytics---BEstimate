So it's a variety of types , ( mountain bikes, BMX girls and boys) youth bikes) I believe I have close to everything they all need to be complete. They are almost complete already except maybe a tire, or brakes, simple things for someone who builds bikes or fixes and sells them. It's quite a bit of stuff to be honest. I'd like to sell it all as a lot for 250.00 as I know if you resell these your going to profit a much higher margin amount and making your 250 back easily. So it's actually a steal for the right person. If interested please text  show contact info  to set up a meeting time to come check out what I have.

I don't reply to emails or follow instructions to email people. Contact me on my phone. call or text. six 6 one. six 4 five. 48 ninety. I'm happy to send close-up pics of any of these bikes. THE BIKES.....  All have perfect working shifters. All have fresh new cables.   First is the Trek Y-5. $600 The polished aluminum full suspension bike, in the first pic. It is perfect working and in almost new condition. All the components are original, and show no signs of mileage. It is like it was ridden 10 times and then set aside. It is valuable as an American made, vintage collectable or as an Everyday bike for real off-road or just running errands. New bikes are Junk in this price range compared to this.   Second, is the Green ride share bike. $200 They are indestructible (almost)! The tires can't go flat. Comes with a basket, kickstand, bell, phone holder.   Third, The Black Trek bike is a ""2017 conduit"" $1,000 - a mid-drive E-bike. It works like it should. It has 1,800 miles on the odometer. I have it's original key and charger.  #4 A Green and Purple Trek 830 from the 1990's. $250.. It has been meticulously restored, and is super clean, and works like new.  #5 My old ""Owners Bike"". The polished aluminum voyager, from the '90's. This was from my old store where this bike needed wheels, cranks, handle bars, all because it came off this customers car rack on the freeway. They left it for me and thru the years when I wasn't busy, I customized it into this. The only original parts are the frame and fork. Everything else was a custom choice off of our shelves, to build a cool ride. It is now 9 speed Shimano shifting with Bontrager wheels and Profile cranks, chain ring and bottom bracket, Fly handlebars, a Thompson post, WTB seat, and Odyessy pedals. I stuck a rak on the back to run errands on this baby. price? make me an offer if it speaks to you...  Call or text. I don't bite.
