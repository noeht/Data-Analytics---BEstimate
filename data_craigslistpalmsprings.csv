The mountains are calling. Will you answer?  Cyberbike eBikes come all with the quietest and most powerful motor in its class, with a long range (65 miles and more) battery, and powerful e-spec hydraulic disk brakes that will be there when you need them.

We have been servicing many of them for many years and they are proven quality right along side the Vespas and Honda scooters.   Fun, practical, reliable, simple and 72.5 mpg!  This was a trade in for a musician that was ready for a biger bike.  In March 2022 we replaced the front tire, changed the oil and filter and did a full inspection.  Yamaha claims it will do 55 miles per hour. I got it up to 50 on our little side street.  Fuelly.com shows these getting an average of 72.5 miles per gallon. Lots of locking storage under the seat. Mechanically it is very nice. It has a lot of scratches as seen in the pictures but no broken plastic  and no problems. This is a great value for around town or to put on the back of your RV for camping trips. You might even want to add a rear trunk or a simple basket on the rear.

If it is a brand name that sounds familiar then  it is worth considering. Most of the China made scooters look new and shinny but are not quality and parts are hard to find.

I am licensed and bonded with the California DMV. I am also a licensed vehicle verifier. If you are in California then I will also collect the sales tax of 7.75% plus a documentation processing charge of $85.00. Plus the title, registration and   transfer fee of $163.00. My buyers (you) never pay back fees or DMV registration penalties.  I will give you a temporary registration permit on the spot and your new registration will come to you in the mail. You will not stand in line at the DMV and there will be no surprises. If you are outside of California and you ship by common carrier then you will pay only the purchase price and I will hand you or mail you the title. I must have a copy of the shipping contract from the driver when picked up or a bill of lading.  Without proof of shipment via common carrier I would still need to collect the 7.75% sales tax",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is big enough for cross country adventures and small enough for around town.  This is a very practical way to commute in style while saving on gas and insurance.  Why buy new and take that huge depreciation on day one?  Why buy new and pay the higher insurance, taxes and anual registration renewals?  This bike has never been dropped. It is beautiful but does have some minor scratches as pointed out in the pictures and the rear fender has a small crack under the tail light.  This is a second owner bike. It comes as pictured with the nice factory Suzuki Boulevard saddle bags,  tall windshield, engine guasrds, floor boards, chrome rack, accessory LED safety lights on the front  forks and flashing red around the lisence plate. Also somes with the owners manual.  This is about as nice of a mix of practicality and cool style that you will find.  Very low miles, fully serviced, needs nothing, fantastic gas mileage, very comfortable and classy looking. The tires are in good condition.

It comes fully equipped and has lots of extras.  It has low mileage usage.  The original owner used it for weekend motorcycle trips.  He thought that he only put on 2500-3000 miles.   I have had it about 3 years and pulled it 5000 miles.  Recently replaced all of the locks on this great RV  Custom hitch (worth $1900) with 60"" x 20"" lockable tool box. That tool box alone is worth $500  Extended length which allows storage of a couple of bikes or small scooter.  I have added both a second battery and propane tank.  Electric hitch post.  Note that this model has wheels outside the bottom of the trailer which makes for much greater stability. Plus the tires are off road capable for those who want to do serious boondocking. It comes with a sway.  I'm also including a 2400 watt generator.(worth $350)  It can't power everything at once but will do a great job if you're careful how much electricity you need while cooking, running the furnace, etc.   I also added two Harbor freight scissor jacks for front stability because the ones included by Forrest River were very insufficient.   Inside, I placed a queen sized futon mattress (w/ springs).  One of the pieces supporting the mattress is designed to be the nook table but the legs are removed.   The detached legs are included.  I also added a small floor freezer (worth $150) so I could enlarge the refrigerator for just cooling items.  Comes with a small remotely operated TV on a mount that allows the TV to be viewed on the couch or bed.  Comes standard with furnace, A/C, fan in the bathroom, sink, propane stove, electric/propane water heater, and a small couch that converts to a kids bed. Decent amount of cabinets but it is a small trailer after all.  The sink faucet has a broken handle but I have purchased a better one that need to be installed.   I'm including sewer hoses, tire stops, and fresh water hose.  Hitch ball is 2""  The standard weight of an Rpod174 is 2300 pounds.  With the custom hitch and second propane tank/battery it will have a dry weight of around 3080 pounds. (certified scale weight)   Add to that the water and cargo you plan to carry in both the trailer and your tow vehicle and make sure it is capable of pulling that weight. (think 3800+) I used a straight 6 Trailblazer LS and it travelled fine, although a bit slow going up long steep hills.  Small SUV's cannot pull this unit safely.  The overall length is 23 feet.   I had Mario's RV Repair check it all out and everything is working.  They did replace the cables from the propane tanks to the splitter and a lose wire on the refrigerator.  ($350 charge) This unit is ready to roll.   The license plate and title are both from Colorado since I live in Denver.  Title is clear. No trades!  Low ballers will be ignored!!   I strongly prefer communication by email or text (I have hearing issues) so sent me a phone number that is textable.  It's currently in storage in N Palm Springs.  I'm in no hurry to sell it. Once again low ballers will be ignored.  Consignment notes:  To view this trailer you must provide me with a phone number to have a short conversation about the consignment process.  Basically you will be working with a business owner in downtown DHS as well as the storage facility where it's located, also in DHS.  Viewing hours are slightly limited due to the limited access to the storage facility.  The buyer will need to bring part cash (for the consignee) and a cashier check which will be mailed to my bank. Thanks for considering my great Rpod",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here is a glimpse at just the top ten uses of utility trailers:  1.Automobiles: From time to time it becomes necessary to haul an inoperable car or truck. Tow trucks are expensive, especially if the distance is great. A utility trailer is a great way to haul vehicles and a good investment if you need to do so regularly.  2.Boats: If you have a boat, you will need a utility trailer to get it to and from the water.  3.Lawn Care Equipment: If you live in a rural area, you may find that you need to haul your mowing equipment from one piece of your property to another. Packing equipment and loading it into a pickup truck bed can get old very quickly. A utility trailer will allow you to drive your equipment right up onto the trailer without the aid of ramps or two strong men.  4.Furniture: Moving furniture is a breeze with a utility trailer. Furniture dollies roll right up onto the trailer and you can haul more than you can with a pickup.  5.Building Supplies: Do you have projects that need to be done around the house? Pick up your own building supplies and save on delivery fees.  6.Bikes, Motorcycles, and ATVs: Recreational vehicles are best hauled on a utility trailer.  7.Livestock: An enclosed utility trailer is most often used to haul livestock.  8.Auction and Flea Markets: If you frequent auctions and flea markets, you will need the hauling capability to bring home your inexpensive and rare finds.  9.Appliances: Utility trailers are ideal for hauling appliances.  10.Debris and Trash: Loading trash in and out of your pickup bed can be cumbersome and clean up can be messy, but it would be worse to have to haul trash in your SUV. Clean up after a big job is a lot easier with a utility trailer.  As you can see, there are many reasons why an investment in a utility trailer is a smart move. I'm sure that with a little time, and its easy availability, you will come up with even more ways to use a trailer  ATV UTV SXS MOTORCYCLE BIKE TRANSPORT HAUL MOVE CAR TRUCK MOVING TRAVELING STORAGE CARGO LOADS AUTHORITY BOAT HAULING BUSINESS BUSINESS FOR SALE JOB SALES CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT STEEL RAZOR SNOWMOBILE POLARIS YAHAMA WILD CAT MACHINE AUTOMOBILE AUTO VAN TOWING TOW VECHICLE SNOW RAIN BOX TRUCK FLATBED GOOSNECK BUMPER PULL HITCH BALL WEATHER BUY WOOD Westchester County, NY Amawalk, Annsville, Archville, Ardsley, Ardsley-on-Hudson, Armawalk, Armonk, Arthur Manor, Banksville, Bayberry Park, Bedford, Bedford Center, Bedford Hills, Beech Hill, Beechmont, Beechmont Woods, Bonnie Crest, Boutonville, Briarcliff Manor, Bronxville, Bronxville Heights, Bryn Mawr Park, Buchanan, Buckhout Corners, Butlerville, Cecil Park, Cedar Knolls, Chappaqua, Chauncey, Chester Hill Park, Chimney Corners, Colonial Acres, Colonial Heights, Crestwood, Crestwood Gardens, Crompond, Cross River, Croton Falls, Croton Heights, Croton-on-Hudson, Crotonville, Crugers, Dobbs Ferry, Dunwoodie, Dunwoodie Heights, East Irvington, East White Plains, East Woods, Eastchester, Eastview, Elmsford, Elmsmere, Fairview, Fleetwood, Forest Knolls, Fox Meadow, Furnace Woods, Gallows Hill, Glendale, Glenville, Glenwood, Goldens Bridge, Graham, Granite Springs, Grant Corner, Greenhaven, Greenville, Grey Oaks, Greystone, Gunther Park, Harrison, Hartsdale, Hastings-on-Hudson, Hawthorne, Heath Ridge, Heathcote, Heritage Hills, Homestead Park, Horseshoe Hill, Horton Estates, Huguenot Park, Irvington, Isle of San Souci, Jefferson Valley, Katonah, Kitchawan, Lake Katonah, Lake Lincolndale, Lake Mohegan, Lake Purdy, Larchmont, Lawrence Park, Lewisboro, Lincoln, Lincolndale, Lowerre, Ludlow, Mamaroneck, Maplewood, Mariandale, Millwood, Milton, Mohegan Heights, Mohegan Lake, Montrose, Mount Airy, Mount Hope, Mount Kisco, Mount Pleasant, Mount Vernon, Murdock Woods, Murray Hill, Nepera Park, Nepperhan, New Rochelle, North Salem, North White Plains, Oceola Lake, Orienta, Oscawana, Ossining, Park Hill, Parkside, Peekskill, Pelham, Pelham Manor, Philipse Manor, Pinebrook, Pinebrook Heights, Pleasantside, Pleasantville, Pocantico Hills, Port Chester, Pound Ridge, Purchase, Purdys, Purdys Grove, Quaker Ridge, Quarry Heights, Residence Park, Ridgeway, Rochelle Heights, Rochelle Park, Roe Park, Rosedale, Rye, Rye Brook, Salem Center, Sarles Corners, Scarborough, Scarsdale, Scarsdale Downs, Scarsdale Park, Scotts Corners, Secor Gardens, Shenorock, Sherman Park, Shore Acres, Shrub Oak, Sleepy Hollow, Sleepy Hollow Manor, Somers, South Salem, Sparta, Spring Valley, Stanwood, Sun Haven, Sunny Brae, Tarrytown, Thornwood, Toddville, Tompkins Corners, Tuckahoe, Twin Lakes Village, Valhalla, Valley Pond Estates, Van Cortlandtville, Vernon Park, Verplanck, Victory Park, Vista, Waccabuc, Waverly, West Mount Vernon, White Birches, White Plains, Whitehall Corners, Wilmot Woods, Windmill Farm, Woodlands, Woodybrook, Worthington, Wykagyl, Wykagyl Park, Yonkers, Yorktown, Yorktown Heights, brooklyn, queens, manhattan, nyc, bronx, staten island, long island, hudson valley",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 790 kit really woke up the bottom end and made it way more responsive. Power from about 2k up depending on gear. Having ridden my wife's DR back to back with mine, the difference is immediately apparent. The DR is a legend around RTW (round the world) travellers due to its reliability and ease of finding parts. The #1 complaint is typically the neutral safety switch in the motor (which has been fixed on this one). It is easy to find examples of these bikes goin 80k miles or more. The extended range tank nets around 225 miles until empty, giving the bike very good range. Riding through Death Valley a few weeks back, fuel range was of no concern.   Tons of spare parts, spare rear wheel, spare front forks, spare rear shock and other parts also included. We bought a parts bike and stripped it of useful parts. Not interested in trades, not interested in discussing price over the phone. Price is negotiable within reason. Text message is preferred. Bought a new bike and can't ride two at the same time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
