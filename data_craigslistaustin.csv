Talk about attention to detail. Most titanium aficionados will already know what this frame is, and it really needs no introduction. But for those who don’t know, this frame features carbon main tubes and 3/2.5V titanium lugs. Mixing ti and carbon already qualifies it as exquisite, as this process isn’t often seen in many bikes. You’ll get ride qualities from both composites, and it’s an elegant way to showcase modern ways connecting with timeless design. More importantly, as you get closer to the bike, the beautifully engraved lugs begin to shine. At the head tube, seat tube and bottom bracket junctions, you’ll see meticulous craftsmanship that makes this bike more of an art piece than anything else. Dura Ace 7800 components adorn the frame; Reynolds Ouzo Pro fork, Easton carbon post and bar finish out the build.

This is 15 years Fatboy anniversary edition. This bike is supper clean and have never been in the rain since I have her; never been down; never involve with any type of accident. She's always in garage with climate control. Everything on the bike from front wheel all the way to rear wheel has been replaced with Harley Davison CHROME PARTS as you can see. All these chrome parts cost more than a bike.  I just recently purchased Road Glide to travel long distance with my wife. so, I don't need 2 bikes; which means Fatboy has to go.

It measures 26” from center line of pedal to the top of the seat clamp. I would not recommend this bike for anyone under 6’-0” tall. The major difference between this bike and an actual fixie, is the back wheel is designed with a coaster brake to help stopping. It is the same concept as most beach cruiser bikes. This 70’s model Schwinn bike was completely stripped down and custom powder coated with matte black finish. It has a new aluminum flat bar handle with death grip skulls. A new Velo plush comfy road bike seat in the original stem. Old school and original reflector pedals (with some patina). New Weinmann 700C red wheels and Michelin Pro Race red wall tires. Super cool bike that probably has 50 miles on it since being renovated. Too many projects, too little time. This bike is ready to go. If the ad is still up, it is still for sale.
