Check out the all-new 2022 Honda Grom, probably the most fun you’ll ever have on two wheels. There’s especially big news this year, because we’ve made some huge improvements to this little pocket rocket. A new engine, with a higher 10:1 compression ratio that increases power and adds to the bike’s zippy performance. And an extra gear in the transmission—that’s right, it’s a five-speed now. Updated digital instruments. Plus a thicker, flatter seat that’s more comfortable and a better fit for taller riders. But the biggest news of all are the Grom’s new body panels. They give the Grom a fresh new look, and they’re easy to remove for customizing your ride. You even get fuel injection, a bigger fuel tank.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And if you’re on a Honda Fury, you can guarantee it. This bike is unlike anything else in our lineup—or anybody else’s. It’s longer, lower, and cleaner than just about anything on the road. Powered by a 1312cc V-twin engine, you get plenty of torque from idle to redline. Check out the raked front end, and the attention to detail that makes this bike so sharp. And that new Pearl Yellow paint makes this bike a real stunner! Plus, since it’s a Honda, it handles better than most other choppers, and offers our world-famous reliability too.Features may include:STYLINGCHOPPER STYLINGThe Fury is one of the most authentic, radically styled custom motorcycles that Honda has ever produced. It features a teardrop seamless fuel tank, an ingenious single-shock rear suspension system and an aluminum swingarm.PERFORMANCEV-TWIN ENGINEA powerful 1312cc, 52-degree V-twin engine with a single-pin crankshaft and dual balancers has plenty of torque, and the feel only a V-twin can deliver.COMFORTLOW SEATThe Fury's super-low 26.9-inch seat height is an integral design element that fits in behind the slim and long fuel tank.DRIVETRAINSHAFT FINAL DRIVEThe shaft final drive is quiet, clean and has been uniquely integrated into the overall design.

It’s engineered to help you go hard over the most technical terrain, and equipped with everything you need for an easy ride home. That starts with the legendary 449cc Unicam® engine packing serious power. And a wide-ratio six-speed transmission that can handle anything from slow-speed maneuvers, up to highway-speed riding. Featuring the famous CRF lightweight twin-spar aluminum chassis, premium long-travel suspension, factory handguards, and all the modern innovations you’d expect on a street legal dirt bike. Put them together, and you have the performance to ride over almost anything, with the versatility to go everywhere.Features may include:VERSATILITYFULLY STREET LEGAL & OFF-ROAD CAPABLEThe CRF450RL is equipped with a catalytic converter and is fully street legal in all 50 states—and off-road capable just about anywhere on the planet. That means you can ride it wherever it’s legal to operate a motor vehicle—in state and national parks, on the road, on public lands. Plus, you don’t need to haul your bike to the trailhead in a truck or on a trailer. Best of all, it makes finding gas (or lunch) a breeze.CONVENIENCEELECTRIC STARTAn electric start system ensures trouble-free starting in all conditions. The electric starter also drives the clutch side of the crankshaft to provide superior lubrication to starter gears while producing a narrow engine with a short, strong crank.PERFORMANCE449cc UNICAM® ENGINEThe CRF450RL’s Unicam cylinder-head combines the best of single- and double-overhead-cam designs, and shares its DNA with our championship-winning CRF450R. The configuration saves weight compared to a dual-overhead-camshaft motor, and the camshaft sits lower in the head for a more compact engine and a lower center of gravity. You also get a narrow included valve angle that flattens the combustion chamber for better ignition flame propagation and a high compression ratio. ENGINEERINGWIDE-RATIO SIX-SPEED TRANSMISSIONLike our CRF450X, the CRF450RL rocks a wide-ratio six-speed gearbox. That gives you a low gear perfect for tight, slow situations, and a top gear that’s tall enough for highway riding to the next gas stop or trailhead.

It’s just the right size for younger riders, with the perfect combination of features to make learning as entertaining as riding. The four-stroke engine provides smooth power delivery that’s easy to harness, and the automatic clutch means riders can focus on the fundamentals without worrying about stalling. Along the way, an adjustable throttle limiter and keyed ignition lets you control its power output. And this year, it comes with new graphics inspired by our champion-motocrossers. The CRF50F is a learning tool, a bonding opportunity, and nonstop fun.Features may include:PERFORMANCEDURABLE, LOW-MAINTENANCE ENGINEIf there’s one thing you can count on with a Honda, it’s the engine. The CRF50F’s Honda four-stroke is famously reliable. That cuts down on frustration and hassles.CONVENIENCEAUTOMATIC CLUTCHBecause there's no clutch lever to master, new riders don’t have to worry about stalling. That makes the CRF50F the perfect tool for learning to shift. In addition, the smooth transmission offers three gear ratios.CONVENIENCEKEYED IGNITIONA removable key helps ensure younger riders can’t ride without an adult’s supervision. Got their homework done early? Let’s go riding!ENGINEERINGADJUSTABLE THROTTLE LIMITERSet the top speed by turning a screw. That helps keep new riders from going too fast, too soon, and lets you match the CRF50F's power output to the rider's skill level.RUGGED STEEL FRAMENew riders are hard on equipment, especially when they’re just starting out. That’s why the CRF50F uses a strong steel frame that’s built to handle the bumps and dings of off-road riding.STYLINGTOUGH BODYWORKLearning to ride is all about - well, learning. And that can be tough on a bike. So we made the CRF50F even tougher. With plastic fenders, tank and other body parts, it’s designed to shrug off dings and scrapes. And with styling inspired by its pro-motocross big brothers, the CRF50F looks like a champ too.

Here is a glimpse at just the top ten uses of utility trailers:  1.Automobiles: From time to time it becomes necessary to haul an inoperable car or truck. Tow trucks are expensive, especially if the distance is great. A utility trailer is a great way to haul vehicles and a good investment if you need to do so regularly.  2.Boats: If you have a boat, you will need a utility trailer to get it to and from the water.  3.Lawn Care Equipment: If you live in a rural area, you may find that you need to haul your mowing equipment from one piece of your property to another. Packing equipment and loading it into a pickup truck bed can get old very quickly. A utility trailer will allow you to drive your equipment right up onto the trailer without the aid of ramps or two strong men.  4.Furniture: Moving furniture is a breeze with a utility trailer. Furniture dollies roll right up onto the trailer and you can haul more than you can with a pickup.  5.Building Supplies: Do you have projects that need to be done around the house? Pick up your own building supplies and save on delivery fees.  6.Bikes, Motorcycles, and ATVs: Recreational vehicles are best hauled on a utility trailer.  7.Livestock: An enclosed utility trailer is most often used to haul livestock.  8.Auction and Flea Markets: If you frequent auctions and flea markets, you will need the hauling capability to bring home your inexpensive and rare finds.  9.Appliances: Utility trailers are ideal for hauling appliances.  10.Debris and Trash: Loading trash in and out of your pickup bed can be cumbersome and clean up can be messy, but it would be worse to have to haul trash in your SUV. Clean up after a big job is a lot easier with a utility trailer.  As you can see, there are many reasons why an investment in a utility trailer is a smart move. I'm sure that with a little time, and its easy availability, you will come up with even more ways to use a trailer  ATV UTV SXS MOTORCYCLE BIKE TRANSPORT HAUL MOVE CAR TRUCK MOVING TRAVELING STORAGE CARGO LOADS AUTHORITY BOAT HAULING BUSINESS BUSINESS FOR SALE JOB SALES CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT STEEL RAZOR SNOWMOBILE POLARIS YAHAMA WILD CAT MACHINE AUTOMOBILE AUTO VAN TOWING TOW VECHICLE SNOW RAIN BOX TRUCK FLATBED GOOSNECK BUMPER PULL HITCH BALL WEATHER BUY WOOD  Westchester County, NY Amawalk, Annsville, Archville, Ardsley, Ardsley-on-Hudson, Armawalk, Armonk, Arthur Manor, Banksville, Bayberry Park, Bedford, Bedford Center, Bedford Hills, Beech Hill, Beechmont, Beechmont Woods, Bonnie Crest, Boutonville, Briarcliff Manor, Bronxville, Bronxville Heights, Bryn Mawr Park, Buchanan, Buckhout Corners, Butlerville, Cecil Park, Cedar Knolls, Chappaqua, Chauncey, Chester Hill Park, Chimney Corners, Colonial Acres, Colonial Heights, Crestwood, Crestwood Gardens, Crompond, Cross River, Croton Falls, Croton Heights, Croton-on-Hudson, Crotonville, Crugers, Dobbs Ferry, Dunwoodie, Dunwoodie Heights, East Irvington, East White Plains, East Woods, Eastchester, Eastview, Elmsford, Elmsmere, Fairview, Fleetwood, Forest Knolls, Fox Meadow, Furnace Woods, Gallows Hill, Glendale, Glenville, Glenwood, Goldens Bridge, Graham, Granite Springs, Grant Corner, Greenhaven, Greenville, Grey Oaks, Greystone, Gunther Park, Harrison, Hartsdale, Hastings-on-Hudson, Hawthorne, Heath Ridge, Heathcote, Heritage Hills, Homestead Park, Horseshoe Hill, Horton Estates, Huguenot Park, Irvington, Isle of San Souci, Jefferson Valley, Katonah, Kitchawan, Lake Katonah, Lake Lincolndale, Lake Mohegan, Lake Purdy, Larchmont, Lawrence Park, Lewisboro, Lincoln, Lincolndale, Lowerre, Ludlow, Mamaroneck, Maplewood, Mariandale, Millwood, Milton, Mohegan Heights, Mohegan Lake, Montrose, Mount Airy, Mount Hope, Mount Kisco, Mount Pleasant, Mount Vernon, Murdock Woods, Murray Hill, Nepera Park, Nepperhan, New Rochelle, North Salem, North White Plains, Oceola Lake, Orienta, Oscawana, Ossining, Park Hill, Parkside, Peekskill, Pelham, Pelham Manor, Philipse Manor, Pinebrook, Pinebrook Heights, Pleasantside, Pleasantville, Pocantico Hills, Port Chester, Pound Ridge, Purchase, Purdys, Purdys Grove, Quaker Ridge, Quarry Heights, Residence Park, Ridgeway, Rochelle Heights, Rochelle Park, Roe Park, Rosedale, Rye, Rye Brook, Salem Center, Sarles Corners, Scarborough, Scarsdale, Scarsdale Downs, Scarsdale Park, Scotts Corners, Secor Gardens, Shenorock, Sherman Park, Shore Acres, Shrub Oak, Sleepy Hollow, Sleepy Hollow Manor, Somers, South Salem, Sparta, Spring Valley, Stanwood, Sun Haven, Sunny Brae, Tarrytown, Thornwood, Toddville, Tompkins Corners, Tuckahoe, Twin Lakes Village, Valhalla, Valley Pond Estates, Van Cortlandtville, Vernon Park, Verplanck, Victory Park, Vista, Waccabuc, Waverly, West Mount Vernon, White Birches, White Plains, Whitehall Corners, Wilmot Woods, Windmill Farm, Woodlands, Woodybrook, Worthington, Wykagyl, Wykagyl Park, Yonkers, Yorktown, Yorktown Heights, brooklyn, queens, manhattan, nyc, bronx, staten island, long island, hudson valley",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We vote yes.Rockin’ the miles made better than ever.You’re looking at the answer to the question, how do you fully load a touring bike with premium features and still roll with the stripped down bagger look? Check inside the sleek Project RUSHMORE batwing fairing and you’ll get an idea. Your looking at the top-of-the-line 6.5 inch touchscreen infotainment system and BOOM!™ Box 6.5 GT audio system. Then check out the details: color matched fairing skirt, 19-inch Enforcer front wheel, custom rear taillight and fascia. The list goes on. Yeah, it’s stripped down But The Street Glide® Special is loaded.Features may include:ControlProject RUSHMORE started out as a way to re-think the venerable Harley-Davidson Touring motorcycle from fender tip to fender tip. It’s turned into a never-ending quest. Each year the going just gets better for the rider who points one of our bikes down the highway. As you might guess, a big part of the effort has gone into finding ways to help riders pass faster, stop quicker, take curves tighter and see further at night. Here are a few of the ways Project RUSHMORE is currently adding the control you feel in the saddle: Reflex™ Linked Brakes with ABS, Daymaker™ LED headlamps and fog lamps, brighter Tour-Pak® luggage carrier lighting, brighter turn signals, brighter brake lights, and a steering head with stiffer front forks. The bikes are better then ever. Project RUSHMORE control. An invitation to see how good you can be, written in Milwaukee steel.InfotainmentWhen we go to work on the infotainment system for a Harley-Davidson Touring motorcycle we follow one simple principle. If you’re going to live in the saddle of a top-end touring bike, you deserve better sound than most people have in their living rooms. More sound. Purer sound. Big, full-color touch screens. Switches that are located where you intuitively want them to be and can reach without removing your hands from the grips. Voice activation for your music, phone and GPS. Think of it this way. Back in the day there was nothing wrong with the sound of Johnny crackling out of a dashboard Philco. But what the latest Project RUSHMORE infotainment systems do for your ears, and eyes, is infinitely better.StyleWith a name like Project RUSHMORE, you know we were aiming high when we set out to rethink what riders experience on our Touring machines. These weren’t just motorcycles. They’re part of the American landscape. So we set about perfecting the way they work, feel and look the only way we could. By riding. Millions of miles. Countless hours. More grueling road tests than any sane person would ever want to endure. We discovered the technology and the innovations to make the ride better. And through it all we never took our eyes of the style of the machine. Give your eyes a slow ride from fender tip to fender tip You see classic Harley-Davidson style and a sleek modern look come through at the same time. Clean. Tight. Modern. As up-to-date as the weather report blasting out the infotainment system. As timeless as the road is endless.

Around town and on the road, the relaxed, stretched-out cruiser style is not only comfortable, but it makes sense too. And the way they look—cruisers turn heads everywhere, even when they’re parked. That’s especially true of the Honda® Stateline®. With its stretched lines and progressive styling, it really stands out. With its 1312cc V-twin engine, shaft final drive, disc brakes and fuel injection, it’s as modern and trouble-free as any Honda® out there, and you know how good that feels.You see a lot of cruisers out there that have too much junk hung all over them. Not the Stateline®. Its streamlined good looks really set it apart. And the way it rides? That puts it even further ahead of the pack.Features may include:InnovationsFive-Spoke Cast WheelsSilver-finish five-spoke wheels never go out of true, are easy to keep clean and just plain look right on a sharp, contemporary cruiser like the Stateline®.Front- and Rear-Disc Brakes (Optional ABS)A single 336mm disc/twin-piston caliper unit up front and 296mm disc/single-piston caliper setup in back ensure the Stateline® can reel itself in when needed.Retro-Progressive StylingLike its Sabre and Fury cousins, the Stateline® with its chopped dragster look, beefy V-twin and long, neo-design fenders, is one of the most authentic, radically styled custom motorcycles that Honda® has ever produced.Tank-Mounted InstrumentsPart of the Stateline®’s super-clean look comes from mounting the instruments in a streamlined, modern tank nacelle. It completely opens up the handlebar area, yet still gives you all the information you need.Programmed Fuel Injection (PGM-FI)Forget about fiddling with a choke—the Stateline®'s fuel injection system means no-hassle startups on cold mornings or at high altitudes, and optimal performance in any condition.1312cc V-Twin EnginePowerful 1312cc, 52-degree V-twin engine with a single-pin crankshaft and dual balancers has plenty of torque, and the feel only a V-twin can deliver.Low-Slung SaddleMeasuring in at an ultralow 26.7 inches, the Stateline®’s wide, one-piece, deep-dish seat not only beefs up the comfort level, but the classic styling as well.Wide, Low-Profile TiresBig, fat and bad to the bone, the Stateline®’s wide, low tires do more than just look good—they are the basis for the Stateline®’s excellent handling. Exactly what you’d expect from a Honda® cruiser.Shaft Final DriveThe shaft final drive is quiet, clean and has been uniquely integrated into the overall design.Full Valanced FendersThose long, full-coverage fenders with their deep side valances are purely modern, but pay tribute to some of the classic cruisers of old. That combination of classic and new is what the Stateline® is all about.

The new KATANA faithfully honors that commitment while finding a bold new expression for Suzuki technology and styling. This new motorcycle was inspired by the original 1982 Suzuki Katana that created a sensation with the motorcycling world when it debuted. Both motorcycles blend a powerful Suzuki engine with radical styling and spirit of the traditional Japanese sword of the samurai.The original Katana had a connection with the GS1100E while this new KATANA is built upon the proven, extraordinary performance of the long-stroke GSX-R1000 engine and the solid stability of the GSX-S1000 chassis. The KATANA’s chassis provides easy control over the GSX-R-based engine and adds a comfortable riding position. The KATANA’s dramatic bodywork rests upon a twin-spar, aluminum alloy frame, and Superbike-type braced swingarm that provides great road holding performance.The stunning styling and performance features of the new KATANA will attract a variety of riders, especially those who value owning a unique motorcycle. Experienced riders fondly remember the original Katana and will want to own the new KATANA so their ride is linked to history. Some potential KATANA riders are seeking out a motorcycle with a distinctive appearance with quality fit and finish that will also deliver an exciting riding experience. Some riders will be drawn to the modern KATANA because of its stimulating styling regardless of its historical connection.Unlike competitors’ retrospective models that are styled and equipped with throwback technology and looks, the new KATANA is a sportbike that has elements of the original but blends in thoroughly modern styling and performance. Like a craftsman folding the steel of a samurai’s sword, the KATANA reflects Suzuki’s ongoing commitment to fine craftsmanship and dedication to make sure every detail of the motorcycles is executed properly.Features may include: Get a grip on a whole new standard. Striking looks. Comfort. Power. Versatility. Our standards deliver easy ergonomics, modern style, and metro muscle in dynamite packages. Whatever type of riding you prefer, our standards can handle it.ENGINEThe KATANA is powered by a 147-horsepower (110-kilowat) powerplant developed from the legendary 2005-2008 GSX-R1000 engine architecture.TRANSMISSIONThe KATANA’s race-proven six-speed close-ratio transmission features vertically staggered shafts to reduce overall engine length. This permits the use of a GSX-R-style twin-spar frame.CHASSISThe reasonable seat height of 32.5 inches (825mm) plus the shape of the seat and how it blends into the fuel tank allow the rider to plant their feet firmly on the ground at stops.ELECTRICALThe KATANA is equipped with Suzuki’s Easy Start System that requires just a simple touch of the starter button to fire up the engine (without pulling the clutch lever if the transmission is in neutral).ADDITIONALA variety of Genuine Suzuki Accessories are available for the KATANA, such as a Meter Visor (that functions as a fly screen), Fuel Tank Pad, wheel rim decals, and more are available, plus a large selection of logo apparel.

The frame is the direct descendant of a dynasty which has won 18 titles and 143 grand prix in the 250 GP class and the bike has then been further enhanced by highly developed electronic management systems to improve both engine performance and handling. This is a true vocation of Aprilia, which was the first manufacturer to adopt the Ride By Wire system as standard. The electronic throttle allows the power of the engine to be used to the maximum while reducing fuel consumption and eliminating the classic problems associated with a normal twist grip such as lack of smoothness when opening/closing the throttle. The RbW system also allows different power delivery settings to be selected through its multi-map technology. Aprilia is the first motorcycle manufacturer to have patented its highly developed aPRC dynamic control system which still today is the only one with the exclusive self-calibration and wheelie control features.Features may include:V4 65° Incomparable EngineStability and controlAPRC, The new frontier in technologyVersion & Colors RideNow Powersports Concord address:    254 Concord Parkway S Concord NC, 28027phone:      ☎ (704) 761-4627 ext 19  link:       http://www.ridenowconcord.com/Used-Inventory-2016-Aprilia-RSV4-RR-ABS-Concord-North-Carolina-11211737  contact:    Internet Sales  DisclaimerAdvertised pricing excludes applicable taxes title and licensing, dealer set up, destination, reconditioning and are subject to change without notice.

Now wearing the MT-09 badge and more refined than ever, it features a potent inline-triple motor, adjustable traction control, a fully-adjustable fork, ABS, and an aggressive look unlike anything else on the road.Powerful Inline-TripleThe MT-09’s 847cc CP3® engine combines advanced electronic systems—including YCC-T®, Yamaha D-Mode and multi-mode traction control—with a crossplane concept crankshaft to deliver an exciting, torquey and quick-revving engine character built around rider-centric control.ENGINEAdvanced 3-Cylinder EngineThe MT-09 is powered by an 847cc liquid-cooled, inline 3-cylinder, DOHC engine with downdraft intake and ride-by-wire throttle control. With a 78.0mm x 59.1mm bore x stroke and 11.5:1 compression ratio, it produces an exciting, torquey and quick-revving engine character, perfectly splitting the best characteristics of both 2- and 4-cylinder motors in a compact, lightweight package.Crossplane Concept CP3 DesignThe MT-09’s “Crossplane Crankshaft Concept” engine provides linear torque development in response to the rider’s throttle input, for responsive engine thrust with a strong feeling of power in the low- to mid-rpm range. To boost refinement and provide a smoother ride, the CP3 engine uses a compact counterbalancer to cancel out vibration.CHASSIS/SUSPENSIONCompact, Sporty ChassisThe MT-09 is built around a strong controlled-fill cast aluminum frame. The wheelbase, seat height, fuel tank width, rake and other dimensions are all set to work with the qualities of the compact 3-cylinder engine to achieve a sporty, light and neutral handling character, an upright riding position and a narrow feeling chassis at the seat/tank junction.Fully Adjustable Inverted ForkThe 41mm inverted fork is fully adjustable for compression damping, rebound damping and spring preload. Not only does this allow riders greater flexibility in tuning their MT-09, the fork separates compression and rebound damping into separate fork legs, making it easier to fine-tune for the perfect setup across all 5.4 inches of fork travel.ADDITIONALComfortable, Upright ErgonomicsEnjoy every ride thanks to upright ergonomics that balance front-end feedback with do-it-all practicality. The tapered aluminum handlebar, ideal placement of the seat and footpegs, and ultra-narrow frame and fuel tank create an excellent sense of feel between rider and machine. The long, flat seat improves rider comfort, and is roomier for a passenger, too.LED LightingThe MT-09 features LED headlights for brilliant illumination. The quad headlight unit produces a crisp spread of light for confidence in low-light conditions, and is matched to a 3D taillight design for head-turning style.ELECTRONICSAdvanced Yamaha Chip Controlled ThrottleThe ride-by-wire Yamaha Chip Controlled Throttle (YCC-T®) system senses the slightest throttle input by the rider and instantaneously calculates the ideal throttle valve opening, and then actuates the throttle valves to actively control intake volume. This technology contributes to the rider’s feeling of torque and controllability from the 3-cylinder engine.
