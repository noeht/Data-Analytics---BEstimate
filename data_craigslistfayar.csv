I purchased the bike new for $1200, then put another $250 or so towards accessories, putting it somewhere around $1450 total. I literally rode it 3 times, so that's roughly $150 off per ride ;)  It is essentially new and a great ride. You can use the battery as much or as little as you like, allowing you to effortlessly move between street-style riding and electric. It's beautiful to look at, too!

They let you ride just about anywhere. Plus, their upright seating and sensible riding position let you rack up the miles in comfort. But they face a challenge, too: they need to combine state-of-the-art touring and riding technology with total reliability.And that’s why Honda Africa Twin models are so far out in front of all the rest. Technology? Check out things like Apple CarPlay™, Android Auto™, and of course our available automatic DCT transmission. Reliability? Nobody even comes close to Honda there. Comfort? Hey, you’re talking about the people who build the Gold Wing. Off-road performance? Ever heard of the Baja 1000 or the Dakar Rally? All that expertise goes into every Africa Twin we build.For 2022 we’re offering four different Africa Twin models. Our standard Africa Twin is a great choice for serious off-road enthusiasts, with either a six-speed manual transmission or our optional DCT. For long-distance adventure touring, check out our two Africa Twin Adventure Sports ES models: They offer special features like electronically controlled suspension, an adjustable windscreen, larger fuel tank, heated grips, tubeless tires, and more. They too are available with either manual transmission or DCT. And every Africa Twin in our line features Android Auto this year, along with new control settings and a tasty new color choice.Features may include:POWER1084cc TWIN-CYLINDER ENGINEThe CRF1100L Africa Twin sports one of the best engines ever in an adventure bike. The parallel-twin design is narrow, and delivers torque everywhere from idle to redline. You’ll have more grunt down low, and cruise easy on the open road.ENGINEERINGCRUISE CONTROLHere’s one of the worst-kept secrets in the motorcycling world—Honda Africa Twins make great long-distance touring bikes. To that end, we’ve equipped our Africa Twin models with cruise control, just like our Gold Wings. Your next adventure really starts a couple of hundred miles away? No problem!HANDLINGLONG-TRAVEL FRONT SUSPENSIONThe Africa Twin doesn’t just look like an adventure bike—it’s the real deal. Exhibit A: Check out its long-travel front suspension. The inverted Showa fork is fully adjustable with huge 45mm tubes and 9.1 inches of travel—the most front-end travel in the 1000cc off-road class.CONVENIENCEApple CarPlay™ AND ANDROID AUTO™ Apple CarPlay™* seamlessly integrates your compatible iPhone®* into your new Africa Twin, and Android Auto™ does the same for your Android phone. That means you can use your devices to access maps, music, and other services easily. You’ll have access to weather, playlists and telephone numbers while aboard. Available Bluetooth®-enabled wireless headsets let you communicate more easily than ever. And best of all, with more apps available every day, your bike’s technology and convenience remain on the cutting edge.Sunrise Honda of Rogers1050 WEST HUDSON RD.Rogers, AR 72756Ask for: SALES STAFFPrimary Phone: (479) 903-7373A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 34305924 10416588",,,,,,,,

And after your first ride, you’ll know why. The engine makes tremendous, instant power, thanks to Honda’s exclusive Unicam® design. The chassis is an active part of the handling equation, backed up with premium Showa suspension at both ends. But what the spec charts can’t show is the level of refinement that only Honda brings to the class, all with the goal of letting you rail through the corners, flatten out the whoops, ace the rhythm sections and do it lap after lap with incredible precision.Looking for the best of the best? Then check out our CRF450RWE (WE for Works Edition). We’ve fine-tuned it with special touches like an exclusive Yoshimura exhaust, Twin Air filter, Throttle Jockey seat cover, Hinson clutch basket and cover, premium DID DirtStar LT-X rims, Kashima and titanium nitrate-coated forks, a red cylinder head cover, and hands-on touches like special cylinder-head porting. Both the RWE and the CRF450R get suspension and engine setting changes for 2022, sharpening the best bike on the track even a little more. Ready to win? Because we’re ready to ride.Features may include:HANDLINGLIGHT NARROW FRAMEGreat handling starts with a superior frame, and that’s one place where the CRF450R’s chassis puts you out front. First, it’s light—over a pound and a half lighter than the previous generation’s. By making the frame’s main spars narrow, we save weight, but more important we make the chassis more responsive by fine-tuning the lateral rigidity. The result is a bike that gets into, around, and out of corners faster.ENGINEERINGHYDRAULIC CLUTCHThe CRF450R features the first hydraulically actuated clutch we’ve offered outside of our works bikes. Made by Nissin, it’s the same design as in our Grand Prix MX machines, and performs better than third-party conversions. You get a clutch-lever pull that’s ten percent lighter at its peak, even though it’s paired with a new, stronger 8-plate clutch. Plus, you’ll never have to worry about making a clutch-cable adjustment, even during the longest events.CONVENIENCESEALED AIRBOX AND FILTERAlong with the special air filter, the airbox shape helps deliver more torque. You can access the airbox through the left number plate. And because the CRF450R’s filter has no rubber gasket where it interfaces with the intake boot, cleaning and servicing the filter is faster and less messy than ever.PERFORMANCEEXCLUSIVE WORKS EDITIONSimply stated, the best of the best. The CRF450RWE Works Edition includes all the standard CRF450R features, but also gets a special hand-ported cylinder head; Hinson clutch basket and cover; Twin Air filter, Throttle Jockey graphics and seat cover; upgraded DID DirtStar LT-X rims; an exclusive Yoshimura exhaust system including a titanium header; titanium nitride-coated lower fork legs; revalved suspension; an RK gold chain; special ECU settings; and black triple clamps.

The frame is integrated for disc brakes and it has clearance for larger tires up to 45mm.  KEY PERFORMANCE FACTORS  Versatile gravel geometry  Frame is designed with endurance positioning and shorter chainstays for precise handling, agility and control. The result is confident speed in all situations, from out-of-the-saddle climbs to rugged dirt descents.  Tuned compliance  Innovative Contact XR D-Fuse handlebar and D-Fuse seatpost work as a system to help absorb shock without sacrificing the stiffness needed for aggressive road performance. Added frame clearance for high-volume tires up to 45mm helps smooth out rough roads, gravel and dirt.  All-rounder efficiency  The ALUXX aluminum frame delivers efficient pedaling power and all-round versatility, giving you a smooth, fast ride quality on variable riding surfaces. O",,,,,,,,

RIDE FARTHER.Has there ever been a time when we’ve appreciated a bike like the Honda Gold Wing as much as we do today? It’s designed to let you get out and explore—and to share that precious time with a like-minded companion. You’ll discover (or rediscover) just how much we all need to reconnect with the great outdoors. With its famously smooth 1833 six-cylinder engine, refined bodywork for weather protection, and ample luggage, where you go—and for how long—is totally up to you. Plus, this latest generation of Gold Wing is lighter and more agile, with a level of performance most touring bikes can only dream of. Full of innovative engineering, all Gold Wing models are Android Auto™ compatible, as well as offering Apple CarPlay™ integration. You can choose between a conventional six-speed transmission and Honda’s exclusive automatic seven-speed DCT transmission, depending on the model. And make sure you check out the new color options for 2022!Features may include:PERFORMANCEENGINEThe Gold Wing’s horizontally opposed six-cylinder engine is famously smooth and powerful. The latest version is an 1833cc design that’s over 13 pounds lighter than the previous generation (more than 8 pounds for the DCT versions).HANDLINGDOUBLE WISHBONE FRONT SUSPENSIONOne look and your eyes will immediately go to the Gold Wing’s radical, Honda-engineered double-wishbone front suspension. The innovative design lets us move both the engine and the rider/passenger closer to the front wheel, giving you more room for added comfort as well as stellar handling. ENGINEERINGTHROTTLE BY WIREThe 2022 Gold Wing’s throttle-by-wire system enables features like the bike’s four ride modes and our exclusive Honda Selectable Torque Control (HSTC).COMFORT AND CARGOLARGER TRUNKThe Gold Wing’s trunk now holds 61 liters, up 11 liters from the 2020 model. That means in most cases you can get two XXL full-face helmets in there. Combined, the trunk and saddlebags give you 121 liters of storage, plenty to hold what you need for a weekend’s travels. Available accessories include an auto-on interior light, a luggage rack, and more.

Here is a glimpse at just the top ten uses of utility trailers:  1.Automobiles: From time to time it becomes necessary to haul an inoperable car or truck. Tow trucks are expensive, especially if the distance is great. A utility trailer is a great way to haul vehicles and a good investment if you need to do so regularly.  2.Boats: If you have a boat, you will need a utility trailer to get it to and from the water.  3.Lawn Care Equipment: If you live in a rural area, you may find that you need to haul your mowing equipment from one piece of your property to another. Packing equipment and loading it into a pickup truck bed can get old very quickly. A utility trailer will allow you to drive your equipment right up onto the trailer without the aid of ramps or two strong men.  4.Furniture: Moving furniture is a breeze with a utility trailer. Furniture dollies roll right up onto the trailer and you can haul more than you can with a pickup.  5.Building Supplies: Do you have projects that need to be done around the house? Pick up your own building supplies and save on delivery fees.  6.Bikes, Motorcycles, and ATVs: Recreational vehicles are best hauled on a utility trailer.  7.Livestock: An enclosed utility trailer is most often used to haul livestock.  8.Auction and Flea Markets: If you frequent auctions and flea markets, you will need the hauling capability to bring home your inexpensive and rare finds.  9.Appliances: Utility trailers are ideal for hauling appliances.  10.Debris and Trash: Loading trash in and out of your pickup bed can be cumbersome and clean up can be messy, but it would be worse to have to haul trash in your SUV. Clean up after a big job is a lot easier with a utility trailer.  As you can see, there are many reasons why an investment in a utility trailer is a smart move. I'm sure that with a little time, and its easy availability, you will come up with even more ways to use a trailer  ATV UTV SXS MOTORCYCLE BIKE TRANSPORT HAUL MOVE CAR TRUCK MOVING TRAVELING STORAGE CARGO LOADS AUTHORITY BOAT HAULING BUSINESS BUSINESS FOR SALE JOB SALES CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT STEEL RAZOR SNOWMOBILE POLARIS YAHAMA WILD CAT MACHINE AUTOMOBILE AUTO VAN TOWING TOW VECHICLE SNOW RAIN BOX TRUCK FLATBED GOOSNECK BUMPER PULL HITCH BALL WEATHER BUY WOOD Westchester County, NY Amawalk, Annsville, Archville, Ardsley, Ardsley-on-Hudson, Armawalk, Armonk, Arthur Manor, Banksville, Bayberry Park, Bedford, Bedford Center, Bedford Hills, Beech Hill, Beechmont, Beechmont Woods, Bonnie Crest, Boutonville, Briarcliff Manor, Bronxville, Bronxville Heights, Bryn Mawr Park, Buchanan, Buckhout Corners, Butlerville, Cecil Park, Cedar Knolls, Chappaqua, Chauncey, Chester Hill Park, Chimney Corners, Colonial Acres, Colonial Heights, Crestwood, Crestwood Gardens, Crompond, Cross River, Croton Falls, Croton Heights, Croton-on-Hudson, Crotonville, Crugers, Dobbs Ferry, Dunwoodie, Dunwoodie Heights, East Irvington, East White Plains, East Woods, Eastchester, Eastview, Elmsford, Elmsmere, Fairview, Fleetwood, Forest Knolls, Fox Meadow, Furnace Woods, Gallows Hill, Glendale, Glenville, Glenwood, Goldens Bridge, Graham, Granite Springs, Grant Corner, Greenhaven, Greenville, Grey Oaks, Greystone, Gunther Park, Harrison, Hartsdale, Hastings-on-Hudson, Hawthorne, Heath Ridge, Heathcote, Heritage Hills, Homestead Park, Horseshoe Hill, Horton Estates, Huguenot Park, Irvington, Isle of San Souci, Jefferson Valley, Katonah, Kitchawan, Lake Katonah, Lake Lincolndale, Lake Mohegan, Lake Purdy, Larchmont, Lawrence Park, Lewisboro, Lincoln, Lincolndale, Lowerre, Ludlow, Mamaroneck, Maplewood, Mariandale, Millwood, Milton, Mohegan Heights, Mohegan Lake, Montrose, Mount Airy, Mount Hope, Mount Kisco, Mount Pleasant, Mount Vernon, Murdock Woods, Murray Hill, Nepera Park, Nepperhan, New Rochelle, North Salem, North White Plains, Oceola Lake, Orienta, Oscawana, Ossining, Park Hill, Parkside, Peekskill, Pelham, Pelham Manor, Philipse Manor, Pinebrook, Pinebrook Heights, Pleasantside, Pleasantville, Pocantico Hills, Port Chester, Pound Ridge, Purchase, Purdys, Purdys Grove, Quaker Ridge, Quarry Heights, Residence Park, Ridgeway, Rochelle Heights, Rochelle Park, Roe Park, Rosedale, Rye, Rye Brook, Salem Center, Sarles Corners, Scarborough, Scarsdale, Scarsdale Downs, Scarsdale Park, Scotts Corners, Secor Gardens, Shenorock, Sherman Park, Shore Acres, Shrub Oak, Sleepy Hollow, Sleepy Hollow Manor, Somers, South Salem, Sparta, Spring Valley, Stanwood, Sun Haven, Sunny Brae, Tarrytown, Thornwood, Toddville, Tompkins Corners, Tuckahoe, Twin Lakes Village, Valhalla, Valley Pond Estates, Van Cortlandtville, Vernon Park, Verplanck, Victory Park, Vista, Waccabuc, Waverly, West Mount Vernon, White Birches, White Plains, Whitehall Corners, Wilmot Woods, Windmill Farm, Woodlands, Woodybrook, Worthington, Wykagyl, Wykagyl Park, Yonkers, Yorktown, Yorktown Heights, brooklyn, queens, manhattan, nyc, bronx, staten island, long island, hudson valley",,,,,,,,

Which is why we’re offering two models of our new Honda Talon—probably the most anticipated side-by-sides ever. Both share the same powerful, Talon-specific high-output engine, quick-shifting Automatic DCT Transmission, exclusive I-4WD technology package and all-new chassis. Rider comfort? Nobody does it like Honda. Performance? We’ve built our reputation on it. The key differences between the two: The Talon 1000R has a longer wheelbase, a wider vehicle track, and more suspension travel. It’s a perfect match for riders who tackle rugged, high-speed terrain. The Talon 1000R is proof positive that life is better, side by side.Features may include:ENGINEPOWERFUL 999cc TWIN-CYLINDER ENGINESport side-by-sides need power, and you’re sure to find the new Talon 1000R offers plenty of it. The Talon 1000R’s 999cc liquid-cooled inline twin delivers the kind of powerful torque and quick-revving horsepower you’d expect from a flagship sport model, but is equally responsive in lower revs and in the critical midrange too. Set longitudinally in the chassis and managed by Honda’s sophisticated PGM-FI engine-mapping system, it delivers the kind of refinement no other side-by-side can match.UNICAM CYLINDER HEAD DESIGNThe Talon 1000R’s 999cc liquid-cooled inline twin uses the same proven Unicam® cylinder head design found in our championship-winning motocross bikes. That helps make the engine more compact, which lets us position it for optimal weight distribution and ground clearance.CHASSISCHASSIS AND SUSPENSIONThe Talon 1000R’s refined, high-performance chassis forms the basis for its superior handling and stability. From there we add long-travel independent front and rear suspension and generous ground clearance. Plus, the Talon 1000R gets premium, FOX Podium 2.5 shocks with QS-3 quick adjustors on all four corners.DRIVETRAINAUTOMATIC SIX-SPEED DCT TRANSMISSIONThe convenience of an automatic with the strength, control, and efficiency of a manual, Honda’s DCT lets you drive the way you want. Choose between manual mode or fully automatic. Plus, the addition of Sport Mode increases the fun, shifting at higher RPMs for a spirited, full-performance driving experience. DCT puts you in control as to what engine speed you want, and what gear ratio. Or you can let it do all the thinking for you. In addition, you also get genuine compression braking and a more efficient power delivery than a belt-driven CVT.Sunrise Pre-Owned Motorsports3201 East Park PlazaSearcy, AR 72143Ask for: Pre-Owned Sales5013052900: (501) 305-2900A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 34240346 10380725",,,,,,,,

Or maybe you just want to have some fun outdoors, and don’t want to leave anyone behind. No problem—that’s why we offer our Honda Pioneer 1000-5 models. With room for five occupants, they feature the same smart technology, superior materials, and refined engineering as our three-seat Pioneer 1000 side-by-sides, along with Honda’s world-famous reputation for reliability and quality.Features may include:ENGINEERINGI-4WDThe Pioneer 1000-5 Limited Edition showcases our exclusive I-4WD system. Think “I” for “Intelligent,” because that’s exactly what it is. An industry-first brake-traction control system for side-by-sides, it simplifies operation, increases drivability and optimizes traction. Using proven, advanced technology from Honda’s automotive division, you get the benefits associated with a locked front differential with none of the downsides. That means it maintains front-wheel traction even if one wheel wants to spin on ice or mud or if it’s in a hole. But at the same time, you get the lighter steering, better tracking at high speeds, tighter turning radius, and reduced kickback associated with unlocked front differentials.PERFORMANCEPOWERFUL 999cc TWIN-CYLINDER ENGINEWhen you know the power you need is always at the ready, every drive is an enjoyable experience. And that’s precisely what you get out of the class-leading 999cc liquid-cooled inline twin. Using the same Unicam® cylinder head design found in our motocross bikes, it’s more compact in size, and it still delivers the kind of horsepower and torque you’d expect from a flagship model.HANDLINGCHASSIS AND SUSPENSIONPrepare to go further than ever before. Our refined chassis enables you to tackle terrain others would shy away from, with larger tires, long-travel independent front and rear suspension and huge ground clearance. The rubber mounted engine and exhaust system insulates against excessive vibration and the self-leveling rear suspension compensation for changing loads. Plus, the Pioneer 1000-5 Limited Edition gets premium, quick-adjust FOX QS-3 shocks on all four corners.VERSATILITYQUICKFLIP® SEATINGWant to bring an extra one or two passengers along for the ride? Two QuickFlip® seats pop up from the cargo bed on Pioneer 1000-5 models, giving you the extra seating you need, when you need it. Exclusive to Honda, it’s a smarter system than fixed seat, multi-row models, giving you better maneuverability on the trails.COMFORT3-PERSON CONTOURED BENCH SEATTough, durable and built to enhance every driving experience — yes, we’re talking about the seat. Contoured for three passengers, the center seat is positioned up and forward to maximize space and comfort, and the covering is designed to resist both the elements and heavy use.LCD DISPLAYThe multi-function LCD dash display is large enough to host loads of information, in an easy-to-read way, like speed and fuel level. RPM and transmission mode. Fuel gauge, water temperature, trip information and more. It even includes a clock, so you’ll always know when it’s time for some fun.SAFETYDRIVER/PASSENGER PROTECTIONThe Occupant Protection Structure uses large-diameter tubing, and meets OSHA’s rollover protection standard. The hard doors and roll-up side nets help keep debris from entering the cabin, and auto-style three-point seatbelts are equipped with an emergency locking retractor mechanism, to help optimize passenger security. When you put this much safety first, fun is sure to follow.Sunrise Pre-Owned Motorsports3201 East Park PlazaSearcy, AR 72143Ask for: Pre-Owned Sales5013052900: (501) 305-2900A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 34240350 10380694",,,,,,,,

Call NOW to Apply for Financing Description:2016 Harley-Davidson® Road Glide® SpecialIf you like to dial up the comforts for endless miles on the wide open road, you’re in for one hell of a ride.Set your own boundaries.Like the rock that diverts the mainstream, our frame-mounted Road Glide® Special motorcycle fairing splits the wind and conventional opinion alike. This is an exercise in how far you can take a motorcycle in terms of miles, attitude and function. You’ve got all the Project RUSHMORE features from high output engine and one-touch saddlebags all the way up through the premium 6.5 inch touchscreen infotainment system and BOOM!™ Box 6.5 GT audio system. You also get special features like CVO-style hand-adjustable low-profile rear suspension, gloss black inner fairing and more. The only question is, are you up for it?Features may include:ControlProject RUSHMORE started out as a way to re-think the venerable Harley-Davidson Touring motorcycle from fender tip to fender tip. It’s turned into a never-ending quest. Each year the going just gets better for the rider who points one of our bikes down the highway. As you might guess, a big part of the effort has gone into finding ways to help riders pass faster, stop quicker, take curves tighter and see further at night. Here are a few of the ways Project RUSHMORE is currently adding the control you feel in the saddle: Reflex™ Linked Brakes with ABS, Daymaker™ LED headlamps and fog lamps, brighter Tour-Pak® luggage carrier lighting, brighter turn signals, brighter brake lights, and a steering head with stiffer front forks. The bikes are better then ever. Project RUSHMORE control. An invitation to see how good you can be, written in Milwaukee steel.InfotainmentWhen we go to work on the infotainment system for a Harley-Davidson Touring motorcycle we follow one simple principle. If you’re going to live in the saddle of a top-end touring bike, you deserve better sound than most people have in their living rooms. More sound. Purer sound. Big, full-color touch screens. Switches that are located where you intuitively want them to be and can reach without removing your hands from the grips. Voice activation for your music, phone and GPS. Think of it this way. Back in the day there was nothing wrong with the sound of Johnny crackling out of a dashboard Philco. But what the latest Project RUSHMORE infotainment systems do for your ears, and eyes, is infinitely better.StyleWith a name like Project RUSHMORE, you know we were aiming high when we set out to rethink what riders experience on our Touring machines. These weren’t just motorcycles. They’re part of the American landscape. So we set about perfecting the way they work, feel and look the only way we could. By riding. Millions of miles. Countless hours. More grueling road tests than any sane person would ever want to endure. We discovered the technology and the innovations to make the ride better. And through it all we never took our eyes of the style of the machine. Give your eyes a slow ride from fender tip to fender tip You see classic Harley-Davidson style and a sleek modern look come through at the same time. Clean. Tight. Modern. As up-to-date as the weather report blasting out the infotainment system. As timeless as the road is endless.A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 33277550 10374942",,,,,,,,

You’re not the only one. With its blacked-out styling and great new colors for 2019, this bike will turn heads everywhere you go. And sure, the Rebel is one of our most popular bikes, but it’s also one of our most fun to ride. It has a compact frame and a low-slung seat. You can lean it over in turns due to an impressive tilt angle, and its 471cc parallel-twin engine is specially tuned for power in the middle and upper revs. Plus, it’s begging to be customized, so you can easily make it your own. Express yourself on a Rebel 500 today!Features may include:SPORTY ENGINETwin-cylinder engines are a great choice for a machine like the Rebel 500. Honda twins are famous for their versatility, and the 471cc Rebel 500’s engine is one of our best ever. The parallel-twin engine is narrow, which helps reduce overall bike size. Plus it offers lots of low-rpm torque, but plenty of higher-rpm performance.BLACKED-OUT STYLEThe Rebel is a blank canvas for your self expression. But unlike the canvas you buy at the art store, this one’s not boring white. As is, its black-out engine pieces, frame, and bodywork elements look great during the day and even better at night.LOW SEAT HEIGHTWhen it comes to seat heights, almost everyone likes them lower. At just 27.2 inches, the Rebel has one of the lowest seats in anyone’s lineup. It’s comfortable when you ride, and it makes it easier to flat-foot it at stoplights or in parking lots.SUPERIOR HANDLINGA lot of today’s motorcycles look great standing still, but disappoint once the road gets twisty. At Honda, we set high standards for the way all our bikes handle and feel, and the Rebel is a perfect example—we’ve paid just as much attention to the way this bike corners and handles as we have its knockout styling.Sunrise Pre-Owned Motorsports3201 East Park PlazaSearcy, AR 72143Ask for: Pre-Owned Sales5013052900: (501) 305-2900A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 31997213 10361075",,,,,,,,

Call NOW to Apply for Financing Description:2015 Harley-Davidson® Road King®Timeless cruiser styling combined with all the features you need for the long haul. The Road King® motorcycle truly is the king of the road.Features May Include:Project RUSHMORE - ControlHere are some of the innovations Project RUSHMORE led to: the Reflex™ Linked Brakes with ABS, the Daymaker™ LED headlamps and fog lamps, brighter Tour-Pak® lighting, brighter turn signals, brighter brake lights, and a steering head with stiffer front forks. Locked-up tires are now history even when there’s wet pavement. We’ve made it feel even better to lean your way through a turn. Now you can see better. And we’ve made you more conspicuous to the cage-driving public. Because one thing we all agree on is this: bikes that work better make riders who ride better. Take a ride. See how good you can be.Air-Adjustable SuspensionWith air-adjustable suspension that comes standard, you can dial in your ride to accommodate heavier or lighter payloads, battle unexpected road conditions or simply set it to how you like to roll. The lighter the load, the softer you can go by decreasing the air pressure a bit, or increase the air pressure for a more firm ride. A convenient air valve is located between the saddlebag and rear fender for quick adjusting. It's all about rider and passenger comfort and setting your bike to fit your taste—the easy way.Brembo® BrakesConfidence. Control. High-performance dual disc Brembo® brakes offer consistent stopping power at all speeds. The 4-piston front and rear caliper with dual front rotor brake system is state of the art and top of the line. It's just another way The Motor Company puts a high level of detail into their bikes to give you peace of mind throughout your journey.Reflex™ Linked Brakes with Anti-lock Braking SystemNo doubt about it, there are times when you need to haul things down in a hurry. And you don’t get to pick those times. Or decide whether or not they occur when you’re on a flat, smooth, dry, perfect stretch of pavement. That’s why our touring models feature the Reflex™ Linked Brakes with ABS. ABS turns a locked-up front wheel or a rear wheel skid into a relic from riding’s history. And the front and rear brakes are electronically linked to provide exactly the right amount of brake to each tire no matter what the road condition is. No matter how good you are, this will make you a better rider.Twin Cam 103™ Engine InnovationFire up the Twin Cam 103™ engine and feel the low-end torque unleashed. Thanks to the lightweight piston design, delivery of the added power is more refined than ever. Then put your foot on the shifter and feel how the engine and Six-Speed Cruise Drive® transmission were designed to work together. Six speeds. A strong driveline and strong internal parts. Low routine maintenance. And a low cruising rpm couldn't feel better.A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 32298212 10360089",,,,,,,,

The Hightower has been a does-it-all-well trail bike since its inception. More maneuverable than its longer-travel sibling, the Megatower, and more at home in the steep-and-chunky than its snappy cousin Tallboy, Hightower excels when the route covers ‘all points in between,’ and descents come courtesy of some big-ass climbs. The VPP suspension’s lower-link-mounted shock creates a nearly linear leverage curve, meaning it mops up bumps of all sizes and maintains the kind of progressivity normally reserved for our V10 DH bike!    145mm of rear travel complemented by a 150mm front end gives Hightower just a bit more front and rear travel over the first generation model. Combined with a slacker 65-degree head tube angle, the Hightower still sits squarely in the Goldilocks zone, but with a touch more “Oh sh*t get me out of here” capability when the porridge gets too hot!  Balancing stiffness and weight savings in all the right places is a hallmark of all Santa Cruz carbon frames and the Hightower flies the flag yet higher. The advanced composite chassis tracks well across all trail surfaces, holds a line, and is reactive to rider directions while isolating pedal-influenced inputs.  The Hightower also has a bonus disc to heighten the experience—the flip chip. In the High setting, the BB height is a little higher for those tricky tech trails and/or when Plus sized tires are required. In the Low position the shock rate is more progressive, to provide additional bottom-out resistance. Whatever mood you’re in, the tone of the Hightower can be adapted to meet your individual taste.",, new, frame and fork (full suspension),, none,,,

Check out the all-new 2022 Honda Grom, probably the most fun you’ll ever have on two wheels. There’s especially big news this year, because we’ve made some huge improvements to this little pocket rocket. A new engine, with a higher 10:1 compression ratio that increases power and adds to the bike’s zippy performance. And an extra gear in the transmission—that’s right, it’s a five-speed now. Updated digital instruments. Plus a thicker, flatter seat that’s more comfortable and a better fit for taller riders. But the biggest news of all are the Grom’s new body panels. They give the Grom a fresh new look, and they’re easy to remove for customizing your ride. You even get fuel injection, a bigger fuel tank, and optional ABS. So…more comfortable, more powerful, readily customizable and a fun factor that’s off the charts—bring on the Gromance!Features may include:PERFORMANCE125cc FUEL-INJECTED ENGINEFor 2022, the Grom gets a new engine with higher compression. Nobody can match Honda’s reputation for engines, and even though the Grom may be compact, it’s a giant in terms of performance and reliability.COMFORTLOW SEAT HEIGHTAt just 30 inches the Grom makes it easy to flat-foot it in parking lots or at stop lights. Plus, the new seat is flatter and features thick padding so it’s more comfortable, especially for taller riders.ENGINEERINGHYDRAULIC DISC BRAKESThe Grom features 220mm front and 190mm rear single disc brakes for excellent stopping power.STYLEALL-NEW BODYWORKPart of the fun of owning and riding a Grom is the way it looks. So for 2022 we’ve given the Grom some tasty new bodywork. Plus, it’s easy to remove if you want to customize it even further. In addition, the engine, exhaust, wheels and swingarm are all blacked out for an edgy look.Sunrise Honda of Rogers1050 WEST HUDSON RD.Rogers, AR 72756Ask for: SALES STAFFPrimary Phone: (479) 903-7373A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 34282849 10416595",,,,,,,,

And over the years, our engineers have always stayed true to that vision, but they’ve strived to make the bike better and better. Our 2021 model is a perfect example of that. Refinements abound, but the best parts remain the same. You’ll still have your choice of both manual-transmission models and Gold Wings featuring our exclusive automatic DCT transmission, but this year the trunk is bigger for more road-trip storage, the speakers have a higher 45-watt rating, and the passenger seat on our Tour models is improved. We also freshened up some styling touches, like solid red tail lights and paint choices—check out the grey with orange accent stripe on our no-trunk models! Plus, all Gold Wings are now Android Auto compatible, as well as offering Apple CarPlay™. All in all, a truly great motorcycle gets even better—so your dream ride has everything you’ll need to make memories that last a lifetime.Features may include:PERFORMANCEENGINEThe Gold Wing’s horizontally opposed six-cylinder engine is famously smooth and powerful. The latest version is an 1833cc design that’s over 13 pounds lighter than the previous generation (more than 8 pounds for the DCT versions).HANDLINGDOUBLE WISHBONE FRONT SUSPENSIONOne look and your eyes will immediately go to the Gold Wing’s radical, Honda-engineered double-wishbone front suspension. The innovative design changes the path the wheel travels through the suspension stroke, and that lets us move both the engine and the rider/passenger closer to the front wheel. You get more room, and stellar handling.ENGINEERINGTHROTTLE BY WIREThe 2021 Gold Wing’s throttle-by-wire system enables features like the bike’s four ride modes and our exclusive Honda Selectable Torque Control (HSTC), available on our Gold Wing Tour models.COMFORT AND CARGONEW LARGER TRUNKHere’s some big news for 2021—or should we say bigger news? That’s because we’ve made the Gold Wing’s trunk bigger. It now holds 61 liters, up 11 liters from last year’s models. That means in most cases you can get two XXL full-face helmets in there. Combined, the trunk and saddlebags give you 121 liters of storage, plenty to hold what you need for a weekend’s travels. Accessories include an integrated brake light, an auto-on interior light, and a luggage rack.Sunrise Pre-Owned Motorsports3201 East Park PlazaSearcy, AR 72143Ask for: Pre-Owned Sales5013052900: (501) 305-2900A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 34309084 10406587",,,,,,,,

Using the lithe chassis of the GSX-R750 and a 988cc inline four-cylinder engine design that Suzuki is renowned for, Superbike performance became available to riders everywhere.At the pinnacle of the GSX-R family of ultra-high-performance motorcycles, the 2022 GSX-R1000R’s versatile engine provides class-leading power that is delivered smoothly and controllably across a broad rpm range. Like the original GSX-R1000, the 2022’s compact chassis delivers nimble handling with excellent suspension feel and braking control, ready to conquer a racetrack or cruise a country road. Advanced electronic rider aids such as traction control, launch control, and a bi-directional quick shifter enhance the riding experience while the distinctive, aerodynamic GSX-R bodywork slices through the wind.The GSX-R1000R is equipped with Showa’s BFF and BFRC-Lite suspension components to create an unmatched combination of reliability and performance that can rule any track day.

It's not uncommon to take the SuperMoto down a twisty forest road, around tight canyon corners, or through commuter traffic.Its 398cc, liquid-cooled, four-stroke engine provides strong low-rpm torque and crisp throttle response for any of these occasions. Key differences between the DR-Z400SM and the DR-Z400S are the inverted front fork, wide, spoke-style wheels, and 300mm diameter floating front brake rotor.

Call NOW to Apply for Financing Description:2015 Harley-Davidson® Sportster® 1200 CustomThe ultimate wide-shouldered cruiser.Features May Include:Fat Front EndLeading the way for the 1200 Custom motorcycle is a fat, in-your-face front end. The thick triple clamp and beefy front tire wrapped around a 16-inch 5-spoke chrome cast wheel will not be denied. Take a look and you'll see the true custom character of a Sportster® motorcycle, but just a little fatter and a little more custom.Rear LED LightingLow profile in style, but big and bright when you need it most. The rear LED beam on the 1200 Custom motorcycle fits the contours of the rear fender perfectly, and the array of fast-acting red LED lamps grabs everyone's attention both during the day and at night. License plate mounts are slotted nearby to offer a convenient and noticeable spot for your tag.Chrome 5-Spoke Cast WheelsWhen it comes to custom, standout wheels are a must. The 1200 Custom motorcycle features brilliant chrome 5-spoke wheels that cast striking reflections wherever you go. Custom style for a custom ride.Evolution® Engine HeritageThe Evolution® engine—known in certain crowds as the Blockhead—was first bolted to the frame of a Harley-Davidson® motorcycle back in 1984. Born from legendary Shovelhead and Ironhead engines, the Evolution® engine broke new ground in displacement innovation while maintaining the hunger for power, durability and proven reliability that The Motor Company was built on.Evolution® Engine InnovationAir-cooled and durable as hell, the 1200cc Evolution® engine is yet another nod to the unwavering work ethic that drives advancements in motor technology at Harley-Davidson. Aluminum heads and cylinders lighten the load of the bike and improve air-cooling efficiency. Electronic fuel injection says goodbye to carburetors and boasts increased reliability and less routine maintenance. Bottom line: the rubber-mounted Evolution® engine runs hard and rides smooth for thousands of miles so you can just worry about taking in the freedom of the open road.Pure Harley-Davidson StylingFeast your eyes on the 1200cc Evolution® engine and there's no mistaking its roots. This is authentic Harley-Davidson style through and through with an attention to detail you won't find from any other motorcycle company. Black powder-coated cylinders and cylinder heads are topped off with chrome rocker covers, while chrome pushrods highlight the iconic V-Twin. It's a jewel machined out of metal. Pure. Dripping with power. From the classic edge of the cooling fins to the clean lines of cases and covers—the 1200c Evolution® engine makes an ironclad statement about holding on to what's right and staying true to what satisfies the rider.Foundation Brake SystemLike riding itself, you can never go too far when it comes to improving a bike’s brakes. This is why for we gave the brake system of each Sportster® model a complete overhaul designed to improve performance, fit and finish. We increased the size of the brake rotors from 292mm to 300mm and added a more powerful, stylized front caliper with 34mm pistons and stylized rear caliper to match.

Time to see if there is someone who might enjoy it as much as I did. While it's not as advanced as today's full carbon racers, it's nearly as fast and the mix of carbon and aluminum in the frame allow riders to feel connected to the road without the punishment of a full aluminum frame.  $900 but but to negotiate.  - Original owner since new (2006 model year, built up in 2007) - Specialized Tarmac E5 S-Works (carbon & aluminum) - 57 cm (I'm 6' 1'' and it fits perfect) - Great shape, no wrecks - S-works carbon stem, seat post (available), fork          - Current seat post is Easton with zero setback - Mavic cosmic elite wheels - Ultegra groupo        - rear dérailleur was replaced in 2013 for newer version that allows larger rear cassette for climbing - Selle SMP saddle - Fully maintained and ready to ride!        - Brakes, chain, cassette, bottom bracket, crank are in great shape  - The Ultegra shifters work fine but can be finicky.  - There are signs of age on the frame paint, but still a solid ""B+"" - Needs new bar tape to be top condition (I may elect to wrap) - I don't have an extra set of pedals to go with the bike, flats installed will remain with me  Thanks!",, good,,, none,,,
