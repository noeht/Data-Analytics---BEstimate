The adapter gives the bike a horizontal top tube so that the bike hangs on the rack properly. Non-standard frames are a real pain to strap onto a rack, often ending up hanging crooked and not too secure.  These are very secure. Easy to get on and off. One end of it clips on the handlebar stem under the bars and the other end clips under the seat.  The adapter telescopes longer or shorter to fit the bike.

The bike was completely disassembled, deep cleaned, and rebuilt, piece by piece. It has new stainless steel cables, new cable housings, and new internal ball bearings. Everything works perfectly. And it rides nice and smooth.... Better than new, as mass assembled bikes don't get a mechanic's touch during build-out, often needing grease around the bearings and adjustments to most components. This one also had cheap galvanized cables on it that would rust. Those have all been replaced.  The bike has a 15 inch frame measured from the bottom bracket to the top of the seat tube. I would call this a medium size bike. A rider around 5ft5 to around 6'0 should fit fine.  The bike was completely disassembled. All the components and the drivetrain were removed, deep-cleaned, and adjusted. The front shock was removed and the headset bearings were replaced, greased, and the headset was adjusted. The wheelhub bearings were all replaced, greased, and adjusted. The internal cups and cones where all these bearings travel were all deep-cleaned to provide the cleanest and smoothest surface possible. The wheelhubs are now buttery smooth. The bottom bracket was rebuilt with new ball bearings and fresh grease, and tightened correctly. The wheels were trued, the rims and spokes were individually cleaned. The frame was cleaned and polished. The brake calipers and levers, shifters, derailleurs, cranks and chainrings, and drivetrain were all disassembled and rebuilt. There's not a nut or bolt on the bike I haven't touched.  This is a 21-speed comfort road bike with a step thru frame. The bike has street tires(700c). It has a front shock. The bike has Shimano Tourney derailleurs. It has a Shimano grip shifters. The bike has a shock absorbing seat post and matching seat and grips. The wheels have lightweight alloy rims and hubs, and have nice tires with excellent tread. The bike also has an alloy stem, alloy handlebar, and alloy seatpost to keep things light-ish. The frame is very pretty and is in like new condition.  Due to the vast amount of spam, please put the word DOG into your email and I will reply.   Use the ""more ads by this user"" link to see my other bikes. Link is located on the right side of the ad.    Old grease, combined with dirt, will harden and damage the operation of the bearings. This will cause internal damage, and can make your bike dangerous(especially with the headset bearings which allow you to steer). If you're looking to buy any used bike, find out when the last time the bearings were overhauled (not just a ""tune-up""). If it has not been done in 5 yrs, I strongly recommend having it done.",3,0.0,0.0,aluminum,road,unknown,0.0,1,unknown,0.0,29,0,0,0,0,7

The frame was originally red.  archive.trekbikes.com/us/en/2006/trek/madone55#/us/en/2006/trek/madone55/details When the repair was done Trek would not restore the original paint scheme or original decals to it. The owner was asked what color he preferred. Trek repainted it, and applied the decals and clear coat.   I have disassembled the frame, fork, and components. They were cleaned, regreased where needed, and reassembled.  The headset and bottom bracket are both very smooth. The frame and fork are in very pretty condition.

The only obvious wear is a rub mark on the right crank arm (see pic) and some scratches on the shifter plates (see pics).  It even has the original sticker set on it.  Absolutely nice enough to give as a gift.  Just over 16 pounds on my digital bike scale.  This one has a beautiful Gloss Red Tint with Silver paint job.  It was originally $4400 plus tax in 2008, but since bikes are now so insanely expensive, the new ones are now an eye-watering $8700 plus tax, but they are sold out anyway.  Works great.  2 x 10 Dura Ace drivetrain with a carbon S-Works crankset and Ultegra brakes.  The saddle is fine, but it really is just a filler.

Size is Medium/Large (M/L). I'm 5'9-5""10"" and the bike is a perfect fit, nicely stretched out for road riding. Light, fast, very smooth ride. Shimano (Tiagra) road bike components...very solid equipment group. I bought this model specifically because of the Shimano hydraulic disc brakes which are very powerful and super smooth. Every other manufacturer that year seemed to be downgrading brakes to Tektro to save money. The bike has literally 100-200 road miles on it. I was/am working through a back injury that kept me from riding much shortly after I got it, and I don't ride at all now. So, when I say ""like new"", it's not B.S.   Here is a link to Giant's archived Web page: https://www.giant-bicycles.com/us/bikes-fastroad-slr-2018  The Fastroad SLR 1 was made of ultralight aluminum tubing and has a carbon fork.   I generally hate Craigslist because of the crazies, so be forewarned I'm not going to play games with anyone. No trades, crazy schemes, payment plans, etc. You will get the bike in exactly the condition I'm describing along with all the original paperwork, purchase invoice, etc. Looking for a straightforward sale from a buyer with cash. Test rides with cash held by me from a public location near a police station. Like I said, no games.",4,1.0,1.0,aluminum,road,hydraulic,0.0,2,special,0.0,29,0,0,0,0,19

I bought it after getting out of the hospital from a catastrophic injury with the hopes of getting back into riding again, but more problems have popped up since and I will unlikely ever ride bikes again in any meaningful way. Bike was bought brand new from Epic, and ridden 3 times for a total of 80 miles. Day one upgrades were Whisky 35x760 carbon handlebars, ODI dreadlock grips, Raceface 40mm stem, Vittoria Barzo 2.35 race compound tires, muc-off valves and tubeless set up, and a DT Swiss 1900 rear wheel with a 370 hub. As expected, bike is essentially spotless. Its a big bike, 6'5"" ish and above. Im 6'8"" for reference. My favorite part of this bike is the 35mm seatpost. Larger riders like myself have a tendency to wear out standard sized dropper posts when they are extended out of the frame enough to fit the bike, and the newer 35mm stuff is significantly stronger thn prior sizes such as 30.9mm. Bike has SX drivetrain, X fusion 130mm shock, Tektro Gemini brakes with 180mm rotors and Rockshox 140mm recon fork as it is the base model of the stumpjumper. Boost spacing and thru-axles. Bike is also for sale at Great Bicycle shop where it can be seen and test ridden.

Bontrager Racelite wheels with titanium axles, Michelin Power Pure tires (lighter and less rolling resistance than a GP5000, but a little thinner A very sporty tire at about 50% wear). Full brand new Tiagra 2x10 groupset with 0 miles, brand new Shimano BB, Dura Ace calipers from I believe 3 series ago, so they are old but with brand new pads and are immaculate as is. I originally built the bike up with a full Dura Ace group that matched the calipers but the derailleurs were shot, so I just threw a complete Tiagra group on it. This new 10 speed tiagra shifts wonderfully, nothing like last gen 9 speed stuff. Easton 70 series carbon seatpost with polished head, Bontrager Racelite titanium saddle with red rails. Bontrager Elite stem (i think), and XXX Bontrager carbon bars in 44cm. This is a big bike, for riders 6'5"" and above, but is no slouch Scandium aluminum frame with carbon fork from back when Salsa made road bikes in the early 2000s. As it sits, it has zero miles, I built it up before getting horrifically injured, and I will not be able to ride bikes again unfortunately, so Im thinning out the garage. I never even got to enjoy this one. 50/36 chainrings, 11-28 cassette . Good all around gearing. Derailleur can handle up to a 32 i believe, if you find yourself climbing all day. Bike is also for sale at Great Bicycle Shop where it can be seen and test ridden. Can be bought outside of the shop though, if you prefer. Very unique frame, Ive never seen another like it, and it in great shape save for some very minor wear. It is 20 years old, so its amazing the paint still pops like it does. I matched everything up to suit the early 2000s theme from the wheels to the bars to the saddle and seat post. Clearance for 25s only, maybe 26s. I was able to cram a 28 on the front bit the back was a no-go. Not accepting trades right now, I have to move soon and don't need to take a lot with me.

This bike was stored for a few years and has been revived. Just under 9700K original miles. The dent-free, primered tank has been red-coated on the inside, carbs have been rebuilt, new plugs, fresh oil, pod air filters, custom battery box, fuel lines, fuel filters, and a new gas cap seal have all been added. It starts and runs and pulls in all gears but hasn't been ridden yet this year. It will need a new battery. The tires are not dry rotted, it's been stored indoors all the years I've owned it. It's almost 50 years old. If you are into vintage bikes at all you are aware that they always need a little something tweaked or some basic maintenance or check-up. Pre-ride checks are super important.    This machine has a very cool vintage bike patina going on. Cool but not perfect in any way, worn in but serviceable. It's a real head-turner. The CB360T came stock with a 6-speed transmission which gave it a higher top-end speed versus the CB350, not that it was any better bike. The motor is strong, this bike just needs a good check up by a qualified tech and it'll be ready for the road. I'll send you a detailed list of the extra parts included if you reply with legit contact information. This bike has a clean TN title. I don't need help selling this, if you see this ad then it is still available and still for sale-don't ask, I won't reply to suspicious anything, I won't ship it, no scams.

The only obvious wear is a rub mark on the right crank arm (see pic) and some scratches on the shifter plates (see pics).  It even has the original sticker set on it.  Absolutely nice enough to give as a gift.  Just over 16 pounds on my digital bike scale.  This one has a beautiful Gloss Red Tint with Silver paint job.  It was originally $4400 plus tax in 2008, but since bikes are now so insanely expensive, the new ones are now an eye-watering $8700 plus tax, but they are sold out anyway.  Works great.  2 x 10 Dura Ace drivetrain with a carbon S-Works crankset and Ultegra brakes.  The saddle is fine, but it really is just a filler.

The frame was originally red.  archive.trekbikes.com/us/en/2006/trek/madone55#/us/en/2006/trek/madone55/details When the repair was done Trek would not restore the original paint scheme or original decals to it. The owner was asked what color he preferred. Trek repainted it, and applied the decals and clear coat.   I have disassembled the frame, fork, and components. They were cleaned, regreased where needed, and reassembled.  The headset and bottom bracket are both very smooth. The frame and fork are in very pretty condition. There are some very small scuffs and scratches to the paint.  Due to the vast amount of spam, please put the word DOG into your email and I will reply.

LA Chock Fully Adjustable for any size tire Fully adjustable, fits tires from 80mm to 190mm and 15‚Ä≥ to 26‚Ä≥ wheels Rugged, beautiful powdercoat Integral brackets for bolting down to a trailer Made in the USA The LA Chock (and the smaller footprint LA Trailer Chock) is an innovative and secure motorcycle chock that can be adjusted to fit any size motorcycle tire. Use the LA Chock on your garage floor to provide secure, upright storage for your motorcycle. Just place the stand on the floor and push or ride the motorcycle into the stand. The patented stand clamps onto the front tire and securely holds the motorcycle upright. You can now get off the bike and perform cleaning or maintenance tasks. Mount the LA Chock or the LA Trailer Chock in a trailer and your towing worries are over. Loading is as easy as riding the bike into the stand. Once in, you can get off the bike and secure the bike with straps without someone else having to hold the bike up for you.

Needs restoration.  These were made from 1978 - 1980, according to my information.  It comes with everything in the pictures and it looks complete, even down to the reflectors.

This has been in my shed for 25 years.  Back tire is dry rotted; front tire is also but could possibly be used again.  Seat has a tear as shown, and the shifter has cracks.  Please ZOOM on the pics to see what you think.  It will need an extensive restoration.    SELL:  $400 cash or I would much rather trade for:    a.  American coins, pre-1964 (would even be interested in older non-silver coins such as pennies and nickels)    b.  Classic action figures or Hot Wheels from 1960s - 1990s.  c.

Size is Medium/Large (M/L). I'm 5'9-5""10"" and the bike is a perfect fit, nicely stretched out for road riding. Light, fast, very smooth ride. Shimano (Tiagra) road bike components...very solid equipment group. I bought this model specifically because of the Shimano hydraulic disc brakes which are very powerful and super smooth. Every other manufacturer that year seemed to be downgrading brakes to Tektro to save money. The bike has literally 100-200 road miles on it. I was/am working through a back injury that kept me from riding much shortly after I got it, and I don't ride at all now. So, when I say ""like new"", it's not B.S.   Here is a link to Giant's archived Web page: https://www.giant-bicycles.com/us/bikes-fastroad-slr-2018  The Fastroad SLR 1 was made of ultralight aluminum tubing and has a carbon fork.   I generally hate Craigslist because of the crazies, so be forewarned I'm not going to play games with anyone. No trades, crazy schemes, payment plans, etc. You will get the bike in exactly the condition I'm describing along with all the original paperwork, purchase invoice, etc. Looking for a straightforward sale from a buyer with cash.

First off, what are some examples of repurposing? It is taking a byproduct or waste stream such as a retired street sweeper brush and giving it a 2nd life as a back scratcher for horses or cattle. It is taking a decommissioned fire hose and giving it an extended life as a boat dock fender. It is taking an obsolete ski lift cable and giving it a second life as hand railing in a luxury condo building.   In your efforts to reach Zero Waste, do you have any byproducts or waste from projects now, or coming up, that would be a candidate for repurposing? Or, do you have any surplus/obsolete inventories or idle equipment you'd like to deal on. . . maybe items that have been depreciated out, over orders on a job, inventory from a project that got cancelled, etc.?  We look forward to being a resource on any byproducts, waste, inventories, or equipment that would be a candidate for repurposing!   To date, our company has helped a number of organizations through repurposing: US Army, Denver Broncos, City of Chicago, Nestles, BNSF Railroad, Oklahoma State University, Purina, US National Forest Service, Campbells Soup, State of Wyoming, Paramount Pictures, and many, many more! _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  We are America's largest Industrial Thrift Store!

Unfortunately it's a little too small for me, which discourages me from taking it on longer rides. So it's time to find it a new home!

Not rebuilt engine but Reman WHY DO THEY CHOOSE US QUALITY IS OUR #1  ******* Go Direct with us and SAVE $100's ***********    What are Remanufactured Engines?!  There has always been some discrepancy as to what exactly a remanufactured is. Some may ask, ""Is it just the same as a rebuilt engine ?""  Actually, it is not! What makes a remanufactured engine not a rebuilt or used engine ? Remanufacture means to make as new as possible.  Our remanufactured engines go through a strict process at our Manufacturing Facility that involves the disassembly and assembly of the engine.  New parts are added such as pistons, gaskets, and bearings. The engines are spin tested and engine pressure tested after assembly.  Our professionally trained technicians work diligently through this process to remanufacture engines to make them match factory specifications.  chrysler, dodge and jeep/ Durango, Ram, Sebring, Intrepid, Concord, LHS, 300C, Liberty, Magnum, Cherokee, Dakota, Grand Cherokee  2 in stock   Chevy - suburban, yukon, GMC, Silverado.

We understand that money is tight and replacing your engine can be fairly expensive. However, buying replacement engine ultimately can be more  cost efficient than buying a new or used car, truck, van, or SUV. Buying a remanufactured engine not only saves you money in comparison to buying  a new or used vehicle, it will be able to put your vehicle back on the road with an engine matching factory specifications.

Not rebuilt engine but Reman WHY DO THEY CHOOSE US QUALITY IS OUR #1  ******* Go Direct with us and SAVE $100's ***********    What are Remanufactured Engines?!  There has always been some discrepancy as to what exactly a remanufactured is. Some may ask, ""Is it just the same as a rebuilt engine ?""  Actually, it is not! What makes a remanufactured engine not a rebuilt or used engine ? Remanufacture means to make as new as possible.  Our remanufactured engines go through a strict process at our Manufacturing Facility that involves the disassembly and assembly of the engine.  New parts are added such as pistons, gaskets, and bearings. The engines are spin tested and engine pressure tested after assembly.  Our professionally trained technicians work diligently through this process to remanufacture engines to make them match factory specifications.  chrysler, dodge and jeep/ Durango, Ram, Sebring, Intrepid, Concord, LHS, 300C, Liberty, Magnum, Cherokee, Dakota, Grand Cherokee  2 in stock   Chevy - suburban, yukon, GMC, Silverado.

We understand that money is tight and replacing your engine can be fairly expensive. However, buying replacement engine ultimately can be more  cost efficient than buying a new or used car, truck, van, or SUV. Buying a remanufactured engine not only saves you money in comparison to buying  a new or used vehicle, it will be able to put your vehicle back on the road with an engine matching factory specifications.

It was for sale in Delaware for $3,750.  I had them convert the chainring to a Wolf Tooth 30T and had it shipped (see photos for the original receipt).  I had Andrew at Bikesmith do the assembly when it arrived.  The following components are on the bike: *  Carbon frame *  Fox Float 32 CTD Fit 100mm w/Kashima Fork *  Fox Float CTD w/ Kashima rear shock *  Shimano XT Gruppo  *  Thomson/Renthal cockpit  *  DT Swiss 350/Stan's ZTR Crest Alloy Wheelset  *  Renthal Fatbar Lite Carbon 40mm rise 740mm width 31.8 handlebar  *  Wolf Tooth 30T Drop-stop Chainring  *  Brand-X Ascend 125mm Dropper seatpost (The Ascend is almost exactly the same as the PNW‚Äôs                  Bachelor seat post and likely manufactured by PNW.) *  Wolf Tooth Dropper remote   *  Older Spank Oozy platform pedals as shown in photos (these can be included if you need them or removed)   *  SQ Labs 711 ergo grips OR the still new ODI Ruffian grips that came with the bike   *  ISM Adamo Peak OR the WTB Rocket Saddle that came with the bike  The specifications are reflected in the second photo under the XL size.  I have ridden this bike 1,478 miles over 121 rides since 2018 Rides: 21/2018, 33/2019, 57/2020, 10/2021.   I also own a Lynskey hardtail which get the majority of my saddle time.  Since 2018 the Lynskey has been ridden 3,354 miles or 70% of my total miles. If you weigh more than 190 the Stan's Crest wheelset is likely to take this bike out of your consideration.  The bike as shown weighs about 26.5 to 27.2 lbs without pedals using a less than precise bathroom scale although some reviews indicate a lower weight.  The last two photos show my receipt and the bike as it was originally equipped prior to the 1x10 conversion and the addition of components like the dropper post, handlebars, grips, saddle...

We brought it here, I changed the tires 6 months ago, and started to ride, but very rarely, and it is a pity to leave that beauty unused. Uphill is unbeatable, while downhill, does require skills, like any high-end hardtail.  Known problems: 1. The fork has been left unused for a long time, and it does require service. It works, but it is a bit stiff, and the rebound control is hard to command. Also, one of the stanchions is slightly damaged, due to the dirt that was retained by the seal (see photo). 2.

This bike had an upgrade of a 17.4 amp hour battery, and a frame ""brushed aluminum"" finish, whereby the frames with the highest quality welds and craftsmanship were selected, since the metal was given a clear finish.    I have primarily used the electric assist with a torque sensor, rather than cadence. This makes my peddling feel rather natural. It has different levels of electrical assist. The lowest level (Eco) is designed to just overcome the extra weight of the bike.  Levels 1, 2 & 3 provide increasing assist up to 28 mph. Level S which stands for ‚ÄúSport‚Äù continues to provide assist without any upper speed limit.  The weight of the bike is significant. Maybe about 54 pounds or a little more since I have the extended range battery.  You must take that into account when braking. Remember physics ‚Ä¶ momentum includes velocity and MASS.  The bike is designed to support the extra weight with extra heavy duty spokes, frame, and hydraulic brakes.  I like the idea that the battery pack is on the front down tube and not on the back wheel. This means that one can haul some loads with the bike rack ‚Äî rated for 50 pounds.  The total payload limit is 350 pounds.  I believe you will find the bike is very well thought out and designed and the craftsmanship is excellent. Customer support is pretty good as well.  There was a little bit of assembly required when I received the bike. The headlamp/light they sent had some glue in one of the receptacles. The company quickly sent me a replacement.  I also had a time or two when a fault signal appeared on the charging unit. Technical support readily resolved the issue by walking me through some simple steps.   I have an electronic copy of the instruction manual.  There are a few scratches on it when is the bike tipped over. All damage seems to be cosmetic.

I need to get a tricycle.  :-)  If the Juiced Bikes brand made an electric tricycle, I would buy one in a heartbeat.  This particular model is no longer being manufactured. It has been replaced with the CrossCurrent X. This bike had an upgrade of a 17.4 amp hour battery, and a frame ""brushed aluminum"" finish, whereby the frames with the highest quality welds and craftsmanship were selected, since the metal was given a clear finish.    I have primarily used the electric assist with a torque sensor, rather than cadence. This makes my peddling feel rather natural. It has different levels of electrical assist. The lowest level (Eco) is designed to just overcome the extra weight of the bike.  Levels 1, 2 & 3 provide increasing assist up to 28 mph. Level S which stands for ‚ÄúSport‚Äù continues to provide assist without any upper speed limit.  The weight of the bike is significant. Maybe about 54 pounds or a little more since I have the extended range battery.  You must take that into account when braking. Remember physics ‚Ä¶ momentum includes velocity and MASS.  The bike is designed to support the extra weight with extra heavy duty spokes, frame, and hydraulic brakes.  I like the idea that the battery pack is on the front down tube and not on the back wheel. This means that one can haul some loads with the bike rack ‚Äî rated for 50 pounds.  The total payload limit is 350 pounds.  I believe you will find the bike is very well thought out and designed and the craftsmanship is excellent. Customer support is pretty good as well.  There was a little bit of assembly required when I received the bike. The headlamp/light they sent had some glue in one of the receptacles. The company quickly sent me a replacement.  I also had a time or two when a fault signal appeared on the charging unit. Technical support readily resolved the issue by walking me through some simple steps.   I have an electronic copy of the instruction manual.  There are a few scratches on it when is the bike tipped over. All damage seems to be cosmetic. I had a slow leak in the rear tire and had a local bike shop replace the tube. It was a bit of a challenge for them to get the wheel off, but they managed.",3,1.0,1.0,alloy,hybrid/comfort,hydraulic,1.0,2,special,1.0,27,0,0,0,0,19

I built this in the fall of 2018 and used it primarily as a desert trails runner in the Tucson Arizona area over the winter of 2020-21. It likely has about 50 miles use at the most, as my rides were almost always 2 hour 6-8 mile runs in moderate desert trails and ATV roads. This bike allowed me to get back into cycling, which I love but don‚Äôt have the endurance to take on without help. I‚Äôve learned I can go anywhere and ride all I want, using all my own power that I‚Äôm able, but always having assistance when needed. It has ‚Äòset me free‚Äô and I love it. This bike works great as both a road bike and cross country trails. It is a size small, but as a 5‚Äô8‚Äù / 30‚Äù inseam individual, it‚Äôs not all that small. I found it just barely small enough. This 2018 model is more agile than the newer, more ‚Äòslack‚Äô 2021 frame (specs are available on the internet). This frame has a steeper head angle and shorter wheel base than the newer model. I attached a full details spec sheet as two of the images.  This bike is in excellent condition ‚Äì perfectly true wheels, no dents or dings anywhere, always either covered or garaged, and everything works great. I‚Äôm 70, so I don‚Äôt ride fast nor abuse my equipment, and I‚Äôm a retired auto tech, so I keep my toys in tip-top shape. There is minor paint damage from strapping the bike down for transport and a few minor scratches; but as you can see from the pictures, it still looks great. The tires are almost new; the tubes have Slime installed. The derailleur, cassette and chain are brand new, upgrading to a Shimano Deore derailleur and from the OE 36-11 to a 42-11 cassette for better low-gear performance in steeper, rockier terrain here in the Huachuca mountains of Sierra Vista. The 20AH Lithium battery pack is brand new (I‚Äôm keeping my original LiFePO4 battery). I‚Äôm including many, many spares and all the take-offs from the mid-drive conversion.  The 750W Bafang BBSHD is from Luna Cycles, with the smallest possible chain ring (42 t), and has been programmed for hot-rod performance (not race though. It‚Äôs still limited in speed so it‚Äôs legal, but wow is it strong.) This is the strongest motor I‚Äôve ridden; not even the 1000W units, fully unlimited, have the torque this one does. I have no idea why this is so; but it will put a grin on your face. I fitted a ¬Ω twist RH throttle for climbing really steep stuff; it will make it, no matter what you ask of it, and that was with the 36t rear 1st gear. Now that‚Äôs an even better 42t. It‚Äôs sure to please. It will also be better for pedaling without assist now that the gearing is better.  I have $2,750.00 invested in this. I‚Äôm asking  $1450.00  I can ship this bike to any US territory at the buyer's expense. Serious inquires only, please. If you‚Äôre reading this Ad, then I still have it for sale.

They both need some tune up,  the full suspension bike has a crack in the frame by the seat post.  Perhaps someone mechanically inclined would find some use for the bikes.  I'm asking $400 (or B/O) for both of them (would like to sell them both to one person).  Please let me know of any questions and have a good ride!",3,1.0,0.0,unknown,mountain,mechanical,0.0,unknown,unknown,0.0,unknown,0,0,0,0,11

The closest equivalent is the CrossCurrent X, which also has a rack for panniers and fenders. This bike had an upgrade of a frame with ""brushed aluminum"" finish, whereby only the frames with the highest quality welds and craftsmanship were selected, since the metal was given a clear finish.  It also has an upgraded 17.4 amp hour battery pack, which at 48 Volts can provide 835 Watt hours. Check out the photos and look for a chart showing your potential riding range based on your speed and this particular battery pack (Super Extended). I have primarily used the electric assist with a torque sensor, rather than cadence. This makes my peddling feel rather natural.  The harder you pedal, the more power it gives to the motor. If you pedal lighter, less power goes to the motor. It has different levels of electrical assist. The lowest level (Eco) is designed to just overcome the extra weight of the bike. Levels 1, 2 & 3 provide increasing assist up to 28 mph. Level S which stands for ‚ÄúSport‚Äù continues to provide assist without any upper speed limit.  The weight of the bike is significant. Maybe about 54 pounds or a little more since I have the extended range battery. You must take that into account when braking. The bike is designed to support the extra weight with extra heavy duty spokes, frame, and hydraulic brakes. I like the idea that the battery pack is on the front down tube and not on the back wheel. This means that one can haul some loads with the bike rack ‚Äî rated for 50 pounds. The total payload limit is 350 pounds.  I believe you will find the bike is very well thought out and designed and the craftsmanship is excellent. Customer support is pretty good as well. There was a little bit of assembly required when I received the bike. The headlamp/light they sent had some glue in one of the receptacles. The company quickly sent me a replacement. I also had a time or two when a fault signal appeared on the charging unit. Technical support readily resolved the issue by walking me through some simple steps.  I have an electronic copy of the instruction manual.  There are a few scratches on it when is the bike tipped over. All damage seems to be cosmetic.

The closest equivalent is the CrossCurrent X, which also has a rack for panniers and fenders. This bike had an upgrade of a frame with ""brushed aluminum"" finish, whereby only the frames with the highest quality welds and craftsmanship were selected, since the metal was given a clear finish.  It also has an upgraded 17.4 amp hour battery pack, which at 48 Volts can provide 835 Watt hours. Check out the photos and look for a chart showing your potential riding range based on your speed and this particular battery pack (Super Extended). I have primarily used the electric assist with a torque sensor, rather than cadence. This makes my peddling feel rather natural.  The harder you pedal, the more power it gives to the motor. If you pedal lighter, less power goes to the motor. It has different levels of electrical assist. The lowest level (Eco) is designed to just overcome the extra weight of the bike. Levels 1, 2 & 3 provide increasing assist up to 28 mph. Level S which stands for ‚ÄúSport‚Äù continues to provide assist without any upper speed limit.  The weight of the bike is significant. Maybe about 54 pounds or a little more since I have the extended range battery. You must take that into account when braking. The bike is designed to support the extra weight with extra heavy duty spokes, frame, and hydraulic brakes. I like the idea that the battery pack is on the front down tube and not on the back wheel. This means that one can haul some loads with the bike rack ‚Äî rated for 50 pounds. The total payload limit is 350 pounds.  I believe you will find the bike is very well thought out and designed and the craftsmanship is excellent. Customer support is pretty good as well. There was a little bit of assembly required when I received the bike. The headlamp/light they sent had some glue in one of the receptacles. The company quickly sent me a replacement. I also had a time or two when a fault signal appeared on the charging unit. Technical support readily resolved the issue by walking me through some simple steps.  I have an electronic copy of the instruction manual.  There are a few scratches on it when is the bike tipped over. All damage seems to be cosmetic. I had a slow leak in the rear tire and had a local bike shop replace the tube.

Solid construction: Constructed of the quality magnet, corrosion-resistant alloy roller, and powder coated high carbon steel with the ability to support up to 120kg/264.6lb, our indoor bicycle trainer provides you with the most secure bicycle training method. The stand features an M-shaped design for better stability, safety and adaptability. Space saver: The foldable design renders this magnetic bike trainer rather simple to store without occupying much space when not in use, it can be slid into any narrow place in your room. Its collapsible stand also makes transport a breeze. Smooth operation: This low-noise magnetic turbo gives you a quiet exercise environment. Please note that the noise/friction sound comes from the friction between the wheels and the trainer. Our indoor bike trainer itself doesn‚Äôt contain any noise-causing parts. Functional home gym accessory: This indoor bike trainer fits for 26'' to 28'' and 700C wheels, and comes with a quick-release skewer, so it requires a bike with a rear quick-release wheel. Great for indoor cycling training, also an ideal gift for bicycle lovers. Protective levelness-adjustable feet caps: This magnet turbo trainer is secured by four non-slip feet caps to prevent the trainer from displacing or damaging the floor during a workout. On each gear-like cap, the ‚Äúteeth√¢"""" are varied in thickness. You can rotate the cap and choose the right thickness to level the trainer. 591685(1a vn)""",4,0.0,0.0,alloy,unknown,unknown,0.0,unknown,unknown,0.0,unknown,0,0,0,0,18

Two are Treks and the 3rd is a Diamondback.  the frame and wheel size listed are wrong.  One Trek is the largest they made and the other Trek is the smallest.  The Diamondback is what I'd call a bike for someone around 5' tall or so. The two Treks are rental quality.  We bought them to use everywhere and have zero issues.  If you aren't familiar with rental quality they are kinda bombproof.  They come with very tough frames and upgraded components plus things like tube liners and so forth.  We have loved these but we are headed in a different direction now. All three have a bit of rust.  All three will need a bit of attention.   The Treks were VERY expensive.  We bought them in Sonoma, California where we lived when we purchased them. The Diamondback is only $50. The Treks only have probably about 900,000 miles left.

I literally rode it 3 times, so that's roughly $150 off per ride ;)  It is essentially new and a great ride. You can use the battery as much or as little as you like, allowing you to effortlessly move between street-style riding and electric. It's beautiful to look at, too!

Call NOW to Apply for Financing Description:2016 Harley-Davidson¬Æ Road Glide¬Æ SpecialIf you like to dial up the comforts for endless miles on the wide open road, you‚Äôre in for one hell of a ride.Set your own boundaries.Like the rock that diverts the mainstream, our frame-mounted Road Glide¬Æ Special motorcycle fairing splits the wind and conventional opinion alike. This is an exercise in how far you can take a motorcycle in terms of miles, attitude and function. You‚Äôve got all the Project RUSHMORE features from high output engine and one-touch saddlebags all the way up through the premium 6.5 inch touchscreen infotainment system and BOOM!‚Ñ¢ Box 6.5 GT audio system. You also get special features like CVO-style hand-adjustable low-profile rear suspension, gloss black inner fairing and more. The only question is, are you up for it?Features may include:ControlProject RUSHMORE started out as a way to re-think the venerable Harley-Davidson Touring motorcycle from fender tip to fender tip. It‚Äôs turned into a never-ending quest. Each year the going just gets better for the rider who points one of our bikes down the highway. As you might guess, a big part of the effort has gone into finding ways to help riders pass faster, stop quicker, take curves tighter and see further at night. Here are a few of the ways Project RUSHMORE is currently adding the control you feel in the saddle: Reflex‚Ñ¢ Linked Brakes with ABS, Daymaker‚Ñ¢ LED headlamps and fog lamps, brighter Tour-Pak¬Æ luggage carrier lighting, brighter turn signals, brighter brake lights, and a steering head with stiffer front forks. The bikes are better then ever. Project RUSHMORE control. An invitation to see how good you can be, written in Milwaukee steel.InfotainmentWhen we go to work on the infotainment system for a Harley-Davidson Touring motorcycle we follow one simple principle. If you‚Äôre going to live in the saddle of a top-end touring bike, you deserve better sound than most people have in their living rooms. More sound. Purer sound. Big, full-color touch screens. Switches that are located where you intuitively want them to be and can reach without removing your hands from the grips. Voice activation for your music, phone and GPS. Think of it this way. Back in the day there was nothing wrong with the sound of Johnny crackling out of a dashboard Philco. But what the latest Project RUSHMORE infotainment systems do for your ears, and eyes, is infinitely better.StyleWith a name like Project RUSHMORE, you know we were aiming high when we set out to rethink what riders experience on our Touring machines. These weren‚Äôt just motorcycles. They‚Äôre part of the American landscape. So we set about perfecting the way they work, feel and look the only way we could. By riding. Millions of miles. Countless hours. More grueling road tests than any sane person would ever want to endure. We discovered the technology and the innovations to make the ride better. And through it all we never took our eyes of the style of the machine. Give your eyes a slow ride from fender tip to fender tip You see classic Harley-Davidson style and a sleek modern look come through at the same time. Clean. Tight. Modern. As up-to-date as the weather report blasting out the infotainment system. As timeless as the road is endless.A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 33277550 10374942",unknown,0.0,0.0,steel,hybrid/comfort,unknown,0.0,unknown,unknown,0.0,unknown,0,0,0,0,24

The Road King¬Æ motorcycle truly is the king of the road.Features May Include:Project RUSHMORE - ControlHere are some of the innovations Project RUSHMORE led to: the Reflex‚Ñ¢ Linked Brakes with ABS, the Daymaker‚Ñ¢ LED headlamps and fog lamps, brighter Tour-Pak¬Æ lighting, brighter turn signals, brighter brake lights, and a steering head with stiffer front forks. Locked-up tires are now history even when there‚Äôs wet pavement. We‚Äôve made it feel even better to lean your way through a turn. Now you can see better. And we‚Äôve made you more conspicuous to the cage-driving public. Because one thing we all agree on is this: bikes that work better make riders who ride better. Take a ride. See how good you can be.Air-Adjustable SuspensionWith air-adjustable suspension that comes standard, you can dial in your ride to accommodate heavier or lighter payloads, battle unexpected road conditions or simply set it to how you like to roll. The lighter the load, the softer you can go by decreasing the air pressure a bit, or increase the air pressure for a more firm ride. A convenient air valve is located between the saddlebag and rear fender for quick adjusting. It's all about rider and passenger comfort and setting your bike to fit your taste‚Äîthe easy way.Brembo¬Æ BrakesConfidence. Control. High-performance dual disc Brembo¬Æ brakes offer consistent stopping power at all speeds. The 4-piston front and rear caliper with dual front rotor brake system is state of the art and top of the line. It's just another way The Motor Company puts a high level of detail into their bikes to give you peace of mind throughout your journey.Reflex‚Ñ¢ Linked Brakes with Anti-lock Braking SystemNo doubt about it, there are times when you need to haul things down in a hurry. And you don‚Äôt get to pick those times. Or decide whether or not they occur when you‚Äôre on a flat, smooth, dry, perfect stretch of pavement. That‚Äôs why our touring models feature the Reflex‚Ñ¢ Linked Brakes with ABS. ABS turns a locked-up front wheel or a rear wheel skid into a relic from riding‚Äôs history. And the front and rear brakes are electronically linked to provide exactly the right amount of brake to each tire no matter what the road condition is. No matter how good you are, this will make you a better rider.Twin Cam 103‚Ñ¢ Engine InnovationFire up the Twin Cam 103‚Ñ¢ engine and feel the low-end torque unleashed. Thanks to the lightweight piston design, delivery of the added power is more refined than ever. Then put your foot on the shifter and feel how the engine and Six-Speed Cruise Drive¬Æ transmission were designed to work together. Six speeds. A strong driveline and strong internal parts. Low routine maintenance. And a low cruising rpm couldn't feel better.A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 32298212 10360089",unknown,0.0,0.0,unknown,hybrid/comfort,unknown,0.0,unknown,unknown,0.0,unknown,0,0,0,0,28

Call NOW to Apply for Financing Description:2015 Harley-Davidson¬Æ Sportster¬Æ 1200 CustomThe ultimate wide-shouldered cruiser.Features May Include:Fat Front EndLeading the way for the 1200 Custom motorcycle is a fat, in-your-face front end. The thick triple clamp and beefy front tire wrapped around a 16-inch 5-spoke chrome cast wheel will not be denied. Take a look and you'll see the true custom character of a Sportster¬Æ motorcycle, but just a little fatter and a little more custom.Rear LED LightingLow profile in style, but big and bright when you need it most. The rear LED beam on the 1200 Custom motorcycle fits the contours of the rear fender perfectly, and the array of fast-acting red LED lamps grabs everyone's attention both during the day and at night. License plate mounts are slotted nearby to offer a convenient and noticeable spot for your tag.Chrome 5-Spoke Cast WheelsWhen it comes to custom, standout wheels are a must. The 1200 Custom motorcycle features brilliant chrome 5-spoke wheels that cast striking reflections wherever you go. Custom style for a custom ride.Evolution¬Æ Engine HeritageThe Evolution¬Æ engine‚Äîknown in certain crowds as the Blockhead‚Äîwas first bolted to the frame of a Harley-Davidson¬Æ motorcycle back in 1984. Born from legendary Shovelhead and Ironhead engines, the Evolution¬Æ engine broke new ground in displacement innovation while maintaining the hunger for power, durability and proven reliability that The Motor Company was built on.Evolution¬Æ Engine InnovationAir-cooled and durable as hell, the 1200cc Evolution¬Æ engine is yet another nod to the unwavering work ethic that drives advancements in motor technology at Harley-Davidson. Aluminum heads and cylinders lighten the load of the bike and improve air-cooling efficiency. Electronic fuel injection says goodbye to carburetors and boasts increased reliability and less routine maintenance. Bottom line: the rubber-mounted Evolution¬Æ engine runs hard and rides smooth for thousands of miles so you can just worry about taking in the freedom of the open road.Pure Harley-Davidson StylingFeast your eyes on the 1200cc Evolution¬Æ engine and there's no mistaking its roots. This is authentic Harley-Davidson style through and through with an attention to detail you won't find from any other motorcycle company. Black powder-coated cylinders and cylinder heads are topped off with chrome rocker covers, while chrome pushrods highlight the iconic V-Twin. It's a jewel machined out of metal. Pure. Dripping with power. From the classic edge of the cooling fins to the clean lines of cases and covers‚Äîthe 1200c Evolution¬Æ engine makes an ironclad statement about holding on to what's right and staying true to what satisfies the rider.Foundation Brake SystemLike riding itself, you can never go too far when it comes to improving a bike‚Äôs brakes. This is why for we gave the brake system of each Sportster¬Æ model a complete overhaul designed to improve performance, fit and finish. We increased the size of the brake rotors from 292mm to 300mm and added a more powerful, stylized front caliper with 34mm pistons and stylized rear caliper to match. Other system features include an improved all-aluminum integrated rear master cylinder with reservoir, all-aluminum front master cylinder with reduced friction and higher efficiency, and stainless steel braided lines. It all adds up to more confidence on the road and more power and predictability when you squeeze the brakes.A27FBAFAEA464DBBB650D168074EE06C 31329606 10400050",unknown,0.0,0.0,aluminum,cruiser,unknown,0.0,unknown,unknown,0.0,unknown,0,0,0,0,14

I'm preparing to move so instead of putting my beautiful Felt 9 Trail bike in storage I've decided to pass it on to someone else. I just don't ride anymore.  Specs:  2011 Felt 9 Trail (hard tail) Butted 6061-aluminum 19.5 inch frame SR SunTour 11 series adjustable front fork Shimano, 8-speed: 11-32 cassette  Shimano shifters Tektro IO mechanical disc brakes MTB XC Riser handle bars MTB platform pedals  Front tire/wheel: Bontrager FR3 EXP on 29"" Alexrims Adventurer wheel (I added this myself to give more front bite in turns)  Rear tire/wheel: WTB Prowler SL 2.1 29"" Felt wheel (stock)  Listing all that goodness makes me hate to let this go...but let's proceed.  With a 19.5 inch frame, this is a substantial bike but it handles brilliantly. Lightweight for it's size and being a 29"" wheely the bike sings on the trail. This would be perfect for a larger rider (I'm 6'4"") or for those who like to sit on top of the world when they ride.  It is in great, used condition. I actually didn't ride very much after I purchased the bike new. It has been hanging in my shop for the better part of the past decade.   There are some minimal scrapes and scratches that are to be expected but everything functions just like it did the day I road it from the shop. The only real damage is the sprocket guard which I only noticed was broken when washing the bike for sale. No idea how/when it happened. Of course, it does not at all interfere with riding and can be easily replaced (around $10-$15 at Wal-Mart). Slight wear on the seat/post as pictured.   Included is a like-new Schwinn aluminum gear rack, a brand new tube along with my Presta valve adapter which makes airing up the tires a breeze.  This is one of those ""lifetime"" bikes that will give you years of enjoyment on the trails.  Please ask any and all questions prior to purchase as the sale is final. If you would like additional pictures of a specific part of the bike I'll do my best to get them for you.  I've listed my bike in multiple places but if it sells I'll delete this listing.

It comes with the spare tire kit.  The taillights are LED's.  I have a clear Arkansas title in hand, so you will not have any trouble getting it registered.  This is a great way to haul kayaks without having to lift them onto a roof rack.  The trailer rails will also fit most roof rack accessories- bike trays, cargo pods, etc.    These are sold as kits which require several hours of assembly work.

I would seriously be shocked to find out this has even ever been ridden. I have only found 1 tiny mark in the clear coating. (Not sure if you can even call it a scratch..) This is definitely one of the best condition used frames I have ever seen. You would be hard pressed to find one better! I have bearings that I bought to change, but I don't see how they could possibly need it whatsoever, and I will service the shocks as soon as I get to it, if it doesn't sell first. This bike is immaculate, and needs a good home. The person I bought this from told me it was a 2009, but I'm fairly certain it could be as old as 2007. I still have the 12spd set that I installed first, and can reinstall that if interested. I also have a new chain that is the correct length. That one in the pictures had been previously installed on another bike, but I wasn't aware that it was too short beforehand. I will wrap in foam and ship anywhere in the contiguous US for $150.

One owner, meticulously maintained, always garaged, in very good condition.  Two-tone color: Mysterious Red/Cayenne.  True 49-State bike - I have ridden this bike to every state except Hawaii, and it still has plenty of get-up-and-go.  The only non-stock thing on the bike is the radio antennas - old whip antennas replaced with short ‚Äústubs‚Äù when they wore out.  Cruise control, heated handgrips, security system, touchscreen navigation, radio, CB, cargo rack.  Front tire good, rear tire nearly new.  Extras: sheepskin seat cushion, 3 helmets, rain gear, orange safety vest, intercom system, external bag for mounting on cargo rack, and more.  Similar bikes are listed for ~$20K on Autotrader, but the dealer will only pay me about half the Kelley Blue Book trade-in value.  I'd rather see someone else get a good deal than the dealer make a mint off the bike they assured me would hold its value.  Text, email, or leave a voicemail message.

If you're looking at this ad, you should know that these are the Ferrari of grow lights. They are in AMAZING condition and work perfectly.

Google them for yourself for full specs because its too much to get into here. All you need to know is these are the best of the best. Perfect for cannabis, indoor gardening, micro-green farming, growing your own fruits and veggies indoors. Any type of agriculture cultivation really.   They are able to be ran in configuration with one another or individually using a Trolmaster controller. You can run them without the controller and just plug them into a regular 120v outlet. Ill include the adapter for you. These are the cream of the crop of horticulture lights. Super easy to use.  THESE CAN BE RAN IN EITHER VEG OR FLOWER.  The light bars are removable.   VEG IT COVERS A 7X7 SQUARE FOOT GROW SPACE EACH LIGHT  FLOWER IT COVERS A 5X5 SQUARE FOOT GROW SPACE EACH LIGHT  They normally run $1300+ each IF you can find them. I'll do $1000 each. In the pictures they are at 1% power just to give you and idea, at 100% they are absolutely insane. At 100% power they are as powerful and bright as a 1000W has yet they only use 630 WATTS!  Everybody is worried about density with LED and it is absolutely there. These are full spectrum and more efficient then a HPS. Full spectrum = more purple and more flavor! LED is the future, look at all the big facilities transitioning to LED. Equivalent yields and quality and nearly half the electricity cost.   If you buy MORE then 2 I'll do $900 each. I have 6 left. May be interested in trades for quads? dirt bikes? No more equipment. I have other items if interested.

Tires are good, it needs nothing, it's ready to ride. Includes rear stand, fly screen, tail tidy, stock mirrors, coax acc plug, and that odd skid plate. Handlebar is the comfortable KTM SMT unit, the stock (wide) bar is included. Currently running a 15T sprocket on the front, includes the stock 16T if you want the high stock gearing. I just changed the oil (Motorex) and ALL four filters. Registered till 4/2023.  This bike hasn't been molested, hooned, or tracked. Completely stock engine, emissions, and exhaust. Trakpac is not installed, you can get that for $300 at your fav KTM dealer if you intend to hoon or track the bike.  I'm the second owner, I bought it about one year ago. I'm an old guy and I ride and run my bikes pretty conservatively. The original owner is a reasonable fellow that mostly used it to daily commute Long Beach to Redondo Beach till he got scared one time too many out on the freeway.  It is a fun bike, and gets 50-55MPG. I'm not riding much and now I'm buying a vacation home that needs work and will suck up my free time.  Cash only. My price is firm, it's a hard to find model and I'm not in a hurry.  Thanks Randy  There are just so many time wasting scammers these days. We will have to talk by phone - I will not respond to a text message - call me or text me a number and I'll call you back.

Someone should open up a dirt bike wrecking yard in their backyard like the guy in the bay area should do. I won't mention his name, but he wants to sell whole parts bikes at ridiculously high prices! I've sold him 2 parts bikes at just $100 each!  At the time, I didn't know about E B A Y, as I could of found the ancient parts needed for these bikes and could of seen if they were running bikes! Oh, them days are long gone!   I think I should hold the record for the most longest, boring Craigslist ad ever to be posted in the world !!!!  Who agrees with me ?  IF I WERE TO GET LIKE 20 PEOPLE ALL WANTING the expensive  PARTS,  all at once, THIS BUILD WOULD BE PARTED OUT!   Just added up the total spent, with the 2 parts NOT in the parts listing, total came to $4400.00 and I have it listed at just $2,000!! Crap! I could of purchased a running bike on C R A I G S L I S T at that price! Darn Madera nurse! I wish I would of have not listen to her when she told me to put my mind to work and do something I enjoy doing!!!!   Low on funds, so the reason why I cannot finish this project, buy the coolant, oil up the air filter, change the motor oil, get the gas and pre-mix oil ETC.      TEXT FIVE-HUNDRED-FIFTY NINE-SEVEN-TEN-FOUR THREE-FOUR-ZERO  if interested in purchasing my build at $2,000 FIRM.  1998 YAMAHA YZ 250 PROJECT!   E B A Y BUILD! Project has  not yet been started by me, needs fluids. All  parts have been purchased from E B A Y and ROCKY MOUNTAIN OEM/ ATV.  I have over the listed price in parts, including shipping, so FIRM on price!  Seller of the frame went and had the frame powder coated after sand blasting it, so the V I N  #  I cannot see! I looked on the internet and there it  said the V I N could be found on the frame under the engine somewhere!  I was like, ""0000PS"" but didn't locate it. But this was after the motor was installed into the frame.  He stated to me that  it is as clear as day to read. I have the sellers name and telephone # , just tried hunting for it, couldn't find it. Good news! I just found it! Strange how on this slip, it states 30 lbs. The motor should weigh more, Im guessing, maybe not!  So should  the frame and SUB frame he shipped to me. Frame and SUB is all metal, not aluminum!  I will probably be the one that will be writing up a Bill of Sale as you will be purchasing this bike from me, not him.  I need this project out of my bedroom ! I will show you on my old cellphone, if it can power up still and I can go back on my E B A Y 's buying  page, but probably not though as the thing broke,  and service is shut off,  so the reason why I took the photos from the old phone with this new one,  all the parts l bought and the total I put into this build to show you I am taking a huge loss on the price! I have the parts written  down and the total, so you're just going to have to believe me. I am disabled from a stroke so my mind and damaged brain is not capable of allowing me to return back to riding dirt bikes safely   anymore, something I have been doing since I was like 4 years old, maybe 5 or 6. just turned  51 on February the 5th.  Lord I'm old !  Text 23 hours a day at FIVE-HUNDRED- FIFTY -NINE-SEVEN-TEN-FOUR -3-FOUR-ZERO if interested. Clutch cable needs to be hooked up, the rear wheel when l tighten down the axle nut, makes the rear wheel not spin OK.  I might have the wheel spacers on the wrong side! I will include the bolt and nut kit I bought to install parts with, but most items on E B A Y, used parts, the seller includes them fasteners as they are parting out their bikes,  and there is really nothing else to add to this build as it is complete. A few pictures show the bike as I was building it, but it will roll under her own parts. Stupid me, what I should of done was snap a photo of the bare frame, and everytime a part was added to it,  take a picture. I  do know the motor went into the frame first, that was a job for this disabled male with a broken arm, well the arm was broken in the dirt bike crash,  during the stroke,  and still it feels as though there is a cast still on it that is squeezing the arm. Also it feels like someone is squeezing my hand right now.  I rolled up 2 towels and placed them across the lower part of the frame , to protect the finish , then placed the motor on the 2 towels, then started to get the engine bolts and top mounting bracket  installed. Dealerships  has their way on which side the bolt goes through the hole and what side they place the nut on. I didn't strip this bike down, so?? Then came the triple clamps,  the old grease was completely wiped off of the steering headset bearings, lots of fresh grease was placed on those bearing roller things, AND I even got a small flat blade screwdriver and gently turned each roller and used the flat blade and forced grease into each cavity. Almost used the whole tube at that location. Also the swingarm bearings, under neath them black dust caps, got a wipe down and grease placed under there, too. I've taken apart a 1985 XR 600 that I had that frame powder coated, and l got to restore that bike my way. Frame was powdercoated white, l found a swingarm on E B A Y that was powder coated the frame's orange color, had blue brand new PRO-LINK decals on it, I did 100% all new plastics, including a brand new tank, tank that cost me $350 from the dealership, sold that build for a cheap $500. Stupid me!""   Then, I can't remember if the forks went on next, or was it the radiators, tank, and shrouds, and I built it that way. Stupid stroke. Also, in building the sub frame, it all had to be disassembled to get all of them fasteners to bolt up. Picture shows it as 1 piece with the airbox, side panels, spark arrestor, ETC The seat was just placed on the sub frame for the photo, installing the sub frame  was a job for this disabled male here with his damaged brain and a non usable arm and hand. . After the motor was mated to the frame, I lifted the frame with motor attached, boy was it already heavy, onto the blue plastic city's recycling bin you see in a few photos. After awhile, that blue bin started to slowly give way,  so I had to get the metal stand, yep, also from E B A Y. What was funny when that stand arrived, I simply just pulled it out of its shipping box, and it was ready for usage. As with me kidding around, I emailed the place that sold the stand to me, saying, "" I'm not particularly fond of my purchased item from you not having to be assembled when I removed  it from its box"" as a joke I sent that message! They gave me like a $8 refund! I was joking with them ! Still, some people like to make their customers  happy! Will I be including the stand upon someone buying this dirt bike from me? Probably not as I have other bikes here at the house that this stand could be used for.  And since this stand can slide easily on carpet, the next bike build will need to be placed on it, whenever that day comes.  Also with the loss I am already taking, no need to be adding  to it.  Will let it go for an additional $60.   Anyways:  The seller of the motor and frame included the foot pegs, just was being a jerk and only sent me 1 foot peg spring,  but I think he went and sabotaged the pegs,  as on the part that your boot touches, them spikes,, all of them spikes around the edge of the pegs,, looks  as though they were all filed down recently, making the tips sharp, so do NOT wear good expensive boots while riding with these foot pegs. Nice aftermarkets can be found on E B A Y, stocks also. Seller was an a$$ hole to me during the bidding process as I asked him to send a Bill of Sale  with the frame,  and any hole on the frame, to insert the correct fastener in it, so that I know something needs to be bolted in that hole. Like where the coil bolts onto, he could of put back the correct bolts in those holes as he included the coil. Also, the top end job  he stated was done, he could of included a receipt.  Dont ask me what all was done as he didn't send any paperwork with this motor. A compression check will need to be done. if this motor is even good, I am taking a huge gamble  on this mystery motor. Still these parts aren't like toilet paper, an item that females use everyday,  and us males, every third day so parting her /  him out would  be a slow process.  Help out a poor disabled  man and take on this  year's summer project, bike is a project. Looks like a dirt bike! The suspension has not yet been tested, so hopefully the fork seals are great and the rear shock isn't blown. Forks were only purchased at a price of just $60, then the $40 for shipping, the sales tax brought it up to the price listed in the parts list. Forks cost me less than the rear shock ????????????????? But then I had to purchase a set of triples!   THANK YOU FOR reading this far!  UPDATE:  I switched the wheel spacers around, rear wheel spins better now! Maybe install a new chain and see what that does?  Wheel bearings? Clutch cable attached! Routed correctly? Questionable! I still need to tighten down the front sprocket, the shift pedal, as well as the kickstarter, as we all like those certain items at a specific spot on them shafts, to get your boot under the shifter, where to correctly place the starter on the shaft,   install the fluids, get some gas and change the blood, ( motor oil)  and keep my fingers crossed the bike fires up! I know the clutch and throttle cables will probably need to be adjusted better, but I'm only a novice in doing stuff like that, l know front brakes work great, and the rear has a low brake pedal, will work,  but you got to really push the pedal to the carpet! Bike has NOT left the bedroom since it was put together, so the tires has only touched the bedroom carpet! OOOOOPS, bike is on its E B A Y bought stand, and the front tire is on a piece of cardboard.  Maybe I'm just a damaged weakling? The brake reservoir is full, I'm an old school guy, all my dirt bikes were rear drum brakes so maybe  this is acceptable? I don't know. I do know on my rear drum brake bikes, my boot would rest on the foot peg, as well as the rear brake pedal, causing it to activate when riding, so what I would do is, back off a little on the rear brake adjustment. Saved on rear brake shoes this way. So maybe the really far down to push the rear brakes to the dirt, is this way of not riding  the rear brakes?? Rear brake assemblies can be found on E B A Y should you need to replace the set up.  Reason for the front fender being black is, with the black powder coated swingarm,  I wanted to go with a blue, black and white appearance as much as possible, so the blue and black seat.  We all know what happens to blue plastics after a crash! Yep! Those white stress marks show up. The rear fender has a white stress dot on it. My father's K L X 1 4 0, yes he is that short of a guy,, had a white rear fender, as well as a green front fender. I know Honda on a XR 600, like the 1988 year,  used a red rear fender and a white front fender. Or vise versa. Also with this bike being assembled in pieces, the blue gas tank doesn't match the blue radiator shrouds, as these parts was purchased from different sellers off of different bikes! Hence, the reason for no tank decals on the tank. I thought about purchasing a black fuel tank, but we all know how hard it is to see the fuel level with black fuel tanks!  Trust me on that. Also black parts are hard to see, so the reason I went with the white radiator guards and the white radiator hoses. You can see them better.  Now I see a white air box on E B A Y. NOPE, too expensive and I am low on funds. I won't be switching out no more parts! This is my build, I built it up my way.   LOL  The rear fender, the radiator shrouds, and the brand new front disc brake guard all share  the same shade of blue. Tank doesn't match these parts! Let's keep that a secret between buyer and builder.   Carb is supposed to be brand spanking new, a E B A Y purchased part, so hopefully no adjustment  there is needed as at the carb, things will need to be removed in order to gain access there! Just hopefully the electrical is OK and the bike fires up one day ! I placed an ad on C R A I G S awhile ago asking if the powder coating under neath where the coil bolts to, do I have to go back and scrape off the paint,, for a better ground,, and so I outlined the coil  and slowly had to scrape away the nice paint job! You will never see it. Seller of the motor and  frame is the same guy. He included the wiring harness, the CDI, the coil, and even had a clean spark plug in the head that looked brand spanking new.  Stupid me forgot to check the # on the spark plug to see if it is correct for this motor, so that is something  you will want to do before actually starting her up, and also, to check the gap. Don't want the top of the piston hitting a too long of a spark plug now!  0UCH! I ran the shifter through the gears and they are  engaging, will operate the kickstarter someday.  Thank you for reading this far, hope I haven't bored you too bad ! But please continue to be bored.   L0L Just please don't send me a bill for wasting your time.  Again, for those that cannot read, I'M NOT TAKING ANYMORE OF A LOSS ON THE PRICE AS I AM DOING AT $2000 ! $1995 WON'T buy the bike! $1999 WON'T even! I was offered $1200 by a person by text message that didn't read the whole ad,  came back with a $1300 for his final offer by text. Yes, any amount over the listed price will be greatly appreciated.  LOL I know if I had this build running and registered, it would probably sell quicker, as it will be an all year long green sticker bike. Buy this bike and part him / her out on E B A Y and make yourself a few bucks! I won't mind.   To help you guys out, prices are what I paid on E B A Y, including shipping, if the seller charged for shipping. Some items were the buy it now feature with free  shipping,  and some were the make offer, but now E B A Y is charging sales tax on auctions, just another way us citizens are getting ripped off in this world. If I remember correctly, I do believe the engine and the motor was the only 2  E B A Y listing that were actual auctions, the others were all buy it nows, and make offers. I'm pretty sure I made offers on all make offer auctions. Some items, I paid too much for. On the frame,, I got it at the starting bid,, as no one else in the world needed a 1998 YZ 250 bare frame last year. The motor, I'm guessing the seller had his  buddies bid up the auction, and when it got around to  what he wanted for it, they all stopped bidding. I think I got it for around $950 then the tax and shipping charges!   Here goes.

I know the rear shock was just $75 with free shipping, the tax brought the price up to the listed amount. I can't believe I paid more for the fuel tank, than I did for the FMF header pipe!   And any remaining parts I forgot,  like the brand new kill  switch, and the fuel tank's breather tube,  I'm not going to post , so firm on price at $2,000. The reason for the #61, those were purchased on E B A Y and that was the number. You may change it to whatever # you prefer. I'm just glad it wasn't # 69 ! Would of made me look like I was the pervert!  L0L In 10 more years , 61 will be my age!   Grips and the air filter are probably the only items that are brand new! 000PS, the seller of the header pipe states the pipe was NEVER used, OH and the carb is supposed to be new, the air box mounted mud flap / guard is brand new, and the throttle plastic and housing are new E B A Y items! Would like for this project to go to someone that will finally get her  to the trail someday! I will use the funds from this sale and start up another project, or maybe not! Need to support my Starbucks addiction! With me not selling this build, maybe I will get the radiator coolant, the gas and oil mixture, oil up the air filter, get her fresh oil and see if my build is a YAAAAA ! or a NAAAAA!  How my dirt bike building hobby began was, a long time ago, on E B A Y there was a 1984 YZ 80 being parted out. I wanted to turn the fuel tank into a unique piggy bank. Cut slots in the top to accept the coins.  You just simply turn the thing upside down after unscrewing the fuel tank cap to get the coins to dump out. Well anyways, the fuel tank was all complete, nice, petcock, mounting brackets, nice stock fuel tank decals ETC,  and sold for a great price! The tank arrived, a light bulb went off in my head, saying to me, I cannot afford to buy a dirtbike outright, why not build it piece by piece? And so the dirt bike building  days began. I felt sorry for the 1 guy selling the 85 YZ 80  frame on E B A Y as it only sold for $10 with free shipping. I built the bike,  a red 85 frame, 84 yellow plastics, a black seat, and a front disc brake set up, where as a stock 85 is supposed to be drums in the front. I bought a 1984 YZ80 from a  high school classmate of mine for just $300. My parents bought me a brand spanking new 1985 YZ80 that was only $1200 off the showroom floor,  or out the door,, and even included a spark arrestor!! Oh the cheap prices way back then ! With the extra parts I was getting with building the 1985, I constructed a YZ 80 with a white frame, so let's call him a 1990. The 85 I was able to get running, the 1990, I wasn't so lucky. And stupid me never attempted to diagnose why that 1 wouldnt start, I started parted it out on C R A I G S L I S T, and got the motor sold on E B A Y as a non running motor! Then came K B F L A T F A C E from E B A Y. I guess it is a parting out place on the east coast. There I bought a 1986 Honda Z50R-D frame, forks, swingarm, exhaust pipe, and handlebars from him. The fenders, seat, rear shocks, and fuel tank were all brand new reproduction parts, the motor and wheels were from a Honda Z50R, just not correct for 1986  as they were supposed to be chrome parts.  I never attempted or tried to get the Honda running, added up what I put  into the build, total came to like $1500. I placed the ad on C R A I G S L I S T, got the bike sold to a gentleman living in Pleasanton! The 1985 that I built, later I saw it reposted on CL, the seat cover was all torn up, ripped, and thrashed, I paid like $25 for the seat on E B A Y. So I can honestly say I built 4 bikes all from E B A Y auctions. Just 3 are, or should be still built.  Hopefully 1 day this YZ 250 sells.  The End, hopefully !  Reason why this ad doesn't make since is, I would go back and add to it, because of the stroke I suffered, I dont remember things right away, and so the reason for the carb being listed as brand new a few times. In staring at the fuel tanks cap new breather tube that just arrived yesterday, Valentine's Day, the hose looks as though it is too long and should be shortened by an inch. Will let the new owner decide on that. It's 3"" from top of fuel cap to bottom of the nice color cap breather part on top of the hose.  OK, the end! Definitely!!",2,1.0,1.0,aluminum,unknown,unknown,0.0,unknown,unknown,0.0,unknown,1,0,0,0,14

It's been well cared for and is a blast to ride. It comes with many recent upgrades and a bunch of extras. Components are a mix including XTR, XX1, and a carbon wheel. I have a tendency to stockpile spare parts so that I can swap them in when it's time instead of waiting, so you won't have to spend money on this bike for quite some time. Carbon all across the front end.  The fork has some damage to one stanchion. I'll get a photo posted soon. I've polished the dings which makes them look worse, but perform better. The scratches happened almost three years ago and when seals have been replaced, there is no visible damage to the seals or fluid loss from that side. They were really upsetting when it happened, but those scratches have been completely forgotten by now.  The most recent services were Spring and Fall of 2021:  Spring 2021 - Full overhaul of fork, damper inspection, airspring o-rings and wiper seals replaced. Air cartridge and wiper seals replaced in the seatpost w/ new cable and housing. SRAM DUB bottom bracket and cranks installed w/ new chainring and chain. XX1 shifter installed. New Blunt 35 rim laced to existing Tune rear hub. New rear cassette.  Fall 2021 - Lower leg service on fork. New X01 derailleur and new derailleur hanger. New headset.

Extras: 2 pair brake pads, nearly new cassette, extra CB dropper wiper, Banjo Bros frame bag. I have a full set of new pivot bearing for the whole rear linkage that I just haven't installed yet. I can install them, or provide them for you to take care of in another year.  I'm out here visiting right now with the bike, but many of the extras are back in my garage.  If you buy the bike, I'll ship out a box when I get home in two weeks.  In addition to what's listed, I have extra wheels that I can add in so you have a backup or can have two types of tires ready to go and swap them according to trail conditions.

New emission systems, and new complete radiator, all hoses, and pipes and o rings. New water pump.  I have to smog it, or you can for the discount. $3000.00 if you smog it, $4000 if I do. 176k miles  The 2002 X-type needs a fuel pump or fuse, or relay or module. I haven't had time to do a diagnostic test to see which it is. Worse case scenario, drop the tank and put a fuel pump in for a few hundred bucks.  I just did the front end, cv axels, struts, ball joints and arms, A/C with pump, dryer, orifice, flushed the system.  $2500.00 on non op, runs with starter fluid.

I just put new plugs and wires on it. It's the heavy duty FX4 model 4x4, and really is a work horse. It has a lumber rack, about 1500 con truck from auburn as they are the best! $4500  The Harley Davidson Road King is a 2005 with 30k miles. It runs great with no issues at all. I've changed the oil bi-annually, and the transmission fluid frequently.   The neat thing about this Harley is that I bought a paint kit OEM factor identical to when I bought it. It is smokey gold, and so is the brand new paint kit, which consists of fuel tank, side panels, bags (hard), and front and back fender. I haven't put them on yet, but I can. I thought I'd get a few more scratches and dents and switch them out when I bore out the motor bigger. It will be IN SHOW ROOM CONDITION FOR A 15 year old bike. It has a tour box removable, and that did not come with the OEM new stuff I have. I want 10 grand for the bike with the $2000 paint kit tossed in, so you get a new looking bike when your ready to put some more thunder in it.     I'll get some pics up soon.

We are also buying, selling and trading all manner of quality bicycle, but we are particularly focused on the brands we carry as new bikes like Surly, Salsa, All-City, Bianchi, Linus, SE, etc.  We are a bike store, have listed in the business section and paid the Craigslist fees accordingly.  We accept trade-ins.   All of our used and new bikes are warrantied. We warranty the used bikes ourselves for 60 days against everything including flat tires. The new bikes have the full factory warranty from manufacturer as we are authorized dealers.   You can see all the kids bikes that we currently have here - https://cocosvariety.com/collections/kids-bikes  Sign up for the Bike Alert! Email. We send whenever we have fresh inventory of new or used bikes.   +++++++++++++++++++++++++  Used woom 3 - Green - $350  Well kept and fully tuned by Coco's. Some scuffs and scraps, but very presentable for a kid learning to ride.   woom 3 - 16"" wheels - Ages  4 - 6  +++++++++++++++++++++++++  Used woom 3 - Red - $350  Well kept and fully tuned by Coco's. Some scuffs and scraps, but very presentable for a kid learning to ride.   woom 3 - 16"" wheels - Ages  4 - 6  We were a woom dealer and sold 100's of woom bicycles. When the demand skyrocketed during the pandemic, woom discontinued their small dealer network. We were the only dealer in Southern California. As such, we get a fair number of woom bikes as trade-ins.   +++++++++++++++++++++++++  Used Cleary Owl 20"" - Pink    Well kept, stored inside, little scratches here and there. Cleary is one of the premoer kid's bike manufacturers.  20"" New $430 (we have new Cleary Owls too) Used $350    +++++++++++++++++++++++++  Brand New Evo 24"" and 20"" Mountain Bikes   We have brand new Evo kid's bikes in stock in 20"" and 24"" sizes. Evo is a Euro brand thus the much lower level of graphics and such.  We like them as a lot of kid's bikes like these come with suspension forks which are generally not of high quality, not needed and weigh a lot more. In this configuration, you can ride some dirt, then later, if you are mostly road riding, change to a narrower slink tire.  24"" in mint (as seen) or black 20"" in red  Nice price for quality 7 speed bikes 24"" - $349 - 7 Speed  20"" - $299 - Single speed  +++++++++++++++++++++++++  New Cleary Bikes - Many colors, spec and sizes  We have 20 Cleary bikes in stock. At this time we only have new Clearys in sizes from 16"" -  26"". We believe that the Cleary is the best all around kids bike. The internal 3 and 5 speed hubs are so superior for kids than a derailleur that always get knock out of adjustment. The standard threadless stem set-up like on nice adult bikes means you can replace with longer stem as child ages and get another year or two out of the bike before outgrowing.   You can see the bikes here - https://cocosvariety.com/collections/kids-bikes   +++++++++++++++++++++++++  Used Diamondback 20"" Mountain Bike - Orange   20"" bike, 1 x 6 gripshift, suspension fork, v-brake.  This is a little lower end than we usually sell - more of a Dick's Sporting Goods brand as opposed to a true bike store brand like Giant or Specialized. The bike is of fine quality but it is very heavy.   20"" wheel  Typically 6-9 years old, depending on the child. $100  +++++++++++++++++++++++++  Used Linus 16"" Roadster Blue with training wheels  Some scuffs and scraps but overall this bike is in nice condition. Less than half the price of new Linus 16""s which have reached an astonishing $369 for new ones.  16"" wheel Fits most riders ages 4 to 6 $160  +++++++++++++++++++++++++  Used Linus Lil Roadster in terrific condition. Blue with no training wheels  The most minor flaws distinguish it from a brand new bicycles.   20"" Wheel Typically 6-9 years old, depending on the child. $275   +++++++++++++++++++++++++  Giant Animator 16"" - Blue and White with training wheels  Clean condition! Was kept inside and it shows. Near new.  Small 16"" wheel Generally ages 4-6 $175  +++++++++++++++++++++++++  Used Fuji 20"" Performance Bike - Orange and White  Rare bike! It is a hard to find a kid's bike with the  features of an adult performance hybrid like narrow double wall rims, presta valves, threadless headset, dual pivot brakes, et al.  Ages 7 - 9 $250  +++++++++++++++++++++++++  +++++++++++++++++++++++++   After 14 years of Coco's being open 7 days a week, we have ceased having regular business hours and now people need to call to visit. We are still here 11-6 daily, closed Sundays, so just give us a call to come by and check out the scene.  Coco's buys, sells and trades new and used, vintage and modern bicycles.  Additionally, we are interested in fine art, pottery, early California, vintage automobiles, antiques, old electronics like ancient Apple Computers and vintage hi-if, 4 wheel drive adventure gear, books, records, CDs, tapes, watches and tools so we are always open to interesting trades.

Every bike magazine at the newsstand featured a review. In bike shops around the country there was a lot of gawking and countless test rides. My personal Trek utilizes a Y33 OCLV carbon fiber frame producing a radical looking and light weight structure that is coupled to a highly polished aluminum unified rear triangle. No pedal-induced bobbing with this design which offers predictable behavior, quick responsive steering and a pretty light carbon bike to boot!. It features Shimano Deore XT and  LX components as shown in photos, an extended reach Profile handlebar and a Cloud Nine fully adjustable rear shock  Today, this one owner, always stored inside, seldom used bike is one of the most collectable and highly desired bikes produced. I bought it new here in Florida and is offered in in mint condition with no scratches or flaws anywhere. The original leather seat is perfect. The basic original Trek All Terrain manual is also included.",4,1.0,1.0,carbon fiber,mountain,special,0.0,3,special,1.0,26,0,0,0,0,9

This rad little ride has a sweet ""big kid"" look, thanks to the laser-printed seat, gnarly p-wrap chain guard and a fun handlebar number plate. Since fit is key, the Piston features all new Schwinn SmartStart geometry, a complete redesign of bike geometry that matches a kid's body type to create a more comfortable, ideal riding position. This includes a lighter bike frame for added control, smaller grip handles to match smaller hands, and a more narrow pedal position to match narrow kid hips! Other kids bikes are just shrunken down versions of adult bikes, so typically the grips are too large, the pedals too wide, and the seats are too big.

E5 Premium Aluminum frame features fully manipulated tubing with smooth welds that increase stiffness and efficiency, while looking just as good as it performs. A FACT carbon fiber fork provides incredible stiffness and front end steering response, while also efficiently absorbing road chatter. Shimano Sora 9-speed shifting is nothing short of legendary. It's built to last over the long haul, and it's well-equipped to deliver precise shifts across a wide range of gears. One of the better bikes for the price for a road bike.

The adapter becomes the bike's top tube that gets strapped into the rack.  I don't believe bike shops have these currently because of the shortages.   Can meet in a public place.

The bike was completely disassembled, deep cleaned, and rebuilt, piece by piece. It has new stainless steel cables, new cable housings, and new internal ball bearings. Everything works perfectly. And it rides nice and smooth.... Better than new, as mass assembled bikes don't get a mechanic's touch during build-out, often needing grease around the bearings and adjustments to most components. This one also had cheap galvanized cables on it that would rust. Those have all been replaced.  The bike has a 15 inch frame measured from the bottom bracket to the top of the seat tube. I would call this a medium size bike. A rider around 5ft5 to around 6'0 should fit fine.  The bike was completely disassembled. All the components and the drivetrain were removed, deep-cleaned, and adjusted. The front shock was removed and the headset bearings were replaced, greased, and the headset was adjusted. The wheelhub bearings were all replaced, greased, and adjusted. The internal cups and cones where all these bearings travel were all deep-cleaned to provide the cleanest and smoothest surface possible. The wheelhubs are now buttery smooth. The bottom bracket was rebuilt with new ball bearings and fresh grease, and tightened correctly. The wheels were trued, the rims and spokes were individually cleaned. The frame was cleaned and polished. The brake calipers and levers, shifters, derailleurs, cranks and chainrings, and drivetrain were all disassembled and rebuilt. There's not a nut or bolt on the bike I haven't touched.  This is a 21-speed comfort road bike with a step thru frame. The bike has street tires(700c). It has a front shock. The bike has Shimano Tourney derailleurs. It has a Shimano grip shifters. The bike has a shock absorbing seat post and matching seat and grips. The wheels have lightweight alloy rims and hubs, and have nice tires with excellent tread. The bike also has an alloy stem, alloy handlebar, and alloy seatpost to keep things light-ish. The frame is very pretty and is in like new condition.  Due to the vast amount of spam, please put the word DOG into your email and I will reply.   Use the ""more ads by this user"" link to see my other bikes. Link is located on the right side of the ad.    Old grease, combined with dirt, will harden and damage the operation of the bearings. This will cause internal damage, and can make your bike dangerous(especially with the headset bearings which allow you to steer). If you're looking to buy any used bike, find out when the last time the bearings were overhauled (not just a ""tune-up""). If it has not been done in 5 yrs, I strongly recommend having it done.",3,0.0,0.0,aluminum,road,unknown,0.0,1,unknown,0.0,29,0,0,0,0,7

2350,250.0,lasvegas,https://lasvegas.craigslist.org/wan/d/las-vegas-buy-fridge-washer-beds-pool/7472959429.html,2022-04-18 16:17,"I buy: fridge, washer, beds, pool tables,  furniture, spas, clubs",0.0,"I buy new / used: appliances, refrigerators, washer dryer,  mattress, pool tables, jacuzzi,  steam carpet cleaners. pressure washing  units, cars. trucks,  electric bikes,   I need your (working) full size or mini fridge. Moving? Upgraded? If you have LARGE items: appliances; refrigerator, washer, dryer, pool table, hot tub, sauna, large furniture items, recliner, sofa, cars, bikes, patio furniture, BBQ grill, meat smoker, golf clubs, etc. You deliver = we pay extra. We will pick it up and haul it away to donate for local charities supporting veterans and homeless kids or we buy it to place in rental houses. If it is in GOOD, (clean) working condition, I may want to buy it from you for cash today! For example: your fridge or mattress or appliance or bedroom set is less than 7 years old, and not something you would just throw out to the trash for bulk pickup, or if you are upgrading appliances / furniture and your old unit has a working, functional ice maker, it tests ""good"" as for freon and condensers and fans etc., it's not filthy with frost in the freezer or grime and slime in the refrigerator drawers... I can offer you cash if it's suitable for use or refurbishing.  Send photos of your items to this number. I buy Valley Pool tables and Diamond pool tables. a pool table is worth more if it has NEW (quality) cloth in a nice color, that won't need to be removed to move it, that has good condition rails (the cushions on pool tables last only a few years in the desert) dead-rails need replacement and that costs about $200. New felt (cloth) costs about $300 plus the cost to professionally move it, take it apart, install new cloth, rails, clean the slate, level it and repair any mechanical issues or pockets etc. so the used pool table market does not hold much value when a person can get a new custom table for only a few hundred more than your old junk pool table. Also, most ""bar"" tables are 7' foot or regulation is 9' foot and most 'house' tables are 8' foot, which is not standard to practice on for league players or pros. Most homes can only fit a 7 foot table with enough space around them. Hot tubs: most have a bad heater or bad pump or other issue and it's not worth moving. So, we can determine if your item is worth picking up for free, or if we need to charge you for our service. I have a helper to move big items, plus gas is very expensive and my truck needs maintenance and Ihaveto pay a helper, so I don't BUY your junk but most often, we can haul it away. For fast service, take photos inside and out from as many angles of your refrigerator and clean out your fridge first! Keep it running (plugged in) even if you had to move it to the garage. If it's stored outside, we probably won't want it because it tends to get mice, rats, and debris inside and it will usually be ruined, so even if you just got a new fridge and don't want to pay the delivery guy to haul away yours, just move it to the garage, call or text us, send a description: (measure it, width, heighth, depth from the wall) and describe it. Take a pic of the model and serial number inside where it shows the brand name and date it was built. text the pics to us. Schedule a pick up. It will be gone in 24 hours! I can even save you the delivery fee on your new stuff and bring that for you if you save your good working condition stuff for us. If we won't or can't move it, we will tell you why. If it's filthy, or has food or spilled liquids inside of the fridge, clean it, defrost it by pouring hot water in and soak up the drainage with towels. I will test it, check the temperature and thermostat and test the ice maker. Whatever you do keep it plugged in and don't lay it down on its back or side because it will ruin it in some cases and often we have to stand it up for at least as long as it was laying down so if you had it laying on its back for 24 hours I can't even test it for 24 hours. If it's working, you can send video or pics. Call today for free estimate! No Habla Espanol",3,0.0,0.0,unknown,kids,mechanical,0.0,unknown,unknown,0.0,unknown,0,0,0,0,7

Chain length may vary +/- up to 2"". Professional operators choose Vulcan chain and lock kits to secure millions of pieces of valuable equipment every year ‚Äî including trailers, motorcycles, bikes, and ATVs. Work with confidence, knowing that these chains and locks are backed by the 50 years of manufacturing expertise that only Vulcan can provide. NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFEAT OR CUT - The case hardened chain cannot be cut by hand with bolt cutters, and the lock includes a maximum security mechanism for ultimate protection. The square link shape of the chain does not allow bolt cutters to get a proper grip and the lock has been specially designed to be nearly impossible to grip with burglary tools. If you do not have the keys, you literally need an acetylene torch to defeat this chain and lock kit. HIGHEST QUALITY MATERIALS AND CONSTRUCTION - The solid forged brass one-piece body padlock has an exclusive shape and design that cannot be defeated with any normal burglary tools. The case hardened security chain is hardened to 63 rc at 10% depth and 50 rc in the core, making it impossible to cut with bolt cutters or any other hand tool.

For me, the answer is ""no,"" and that works out pretty well for you.  The DiamondBack Kalamar LX sold for about $200 brand new, which makes it a decent-but-lower-line model in DiamondBack's catalog.  It's a perfect bike for someone looking to tool around the neighborhood, ride some local bike trails, commute to the train station, or use as a ""Fire Island"" bike.  Here's what you may or may not want to change about this bike:  1.  It has some rust on the cassette (the chainrings in the rear) although the gears switch as well as I'm sure they ever did.  Keep it greased and you can get many miles out of it, as-is.  A replacement would be about $25 + labor at your local shop.  There is also some rust on minor parts, but it is mostly aesthetic in nature and should not affect the performance of the bike. 2.  The original chain was completely rusted out so I had to replace it with a slightly-used chain, which had to be connected via the old-school method of popping the pin in and out.  I've had chains last for hundreds of miles that way, but you might want to replace it for $10 with your own labor. 3.  The saddle has a few nicks on it that may or may not bother you.  Most people like to choose their own saddle, anyway, so you might even have one on your current bike to transfer over.  Schwinn sells a big, fat, cushy saddle for $25. 4.  I replaced the inner tube of the front tire with a brand new one; however, I only had one with a Presta-style valve, which is different than the one on the other wheel, which has a Schraeder-style (old standard) valve.  When pumping the tires, you'll need a pump that can handle both, which many current pumps do.  Usually, you have to unscrew the pump head and turn one piece around.  Otherwise, for less than $10, you can purchase a new tube that matches.  They also make adapters for a couple of dollars, but that's jumping the gun a little.  You can see that replacing all these parts before offering the bike for sale would have cost me an additional $70 or more, which means I could not sell the whole bike for $50.  If YOU would like to invest in these parts, you can still have a nice bike for about $125-150.    Unless you're looking to make this your bike-to-end-all-bikes, I don't think you need to spend anything at all on it.  Now, here's what's really cool about this bike:  1.  It's in pretty nice shape, with the exception of a few scratches. 2.  It's a 17"" frame (good for someone around 6' tall) and it's got 28"" (700 X 40c) Kenda tires (nice, large diameter for better speed with fewer revolutions of the pedals) that appear to have very low mileage on them. 3.  It's got a simple 1 X 7 (one gear in front, seven in the rear) drive system with gripshifters for easy clicking from gear to gear.  There is no derailleur on the front, which makes maintenance and shifting a lot easier. 4.  I have installed a new shifter cable and a new rear brake cable. 5.  The bike is designed with upright handlebars for an easy-on-the-back experience and better visibility for you when on the road. 6.  The Kalamar LX has connectors (braze-ons) for a rear rack that you can add on yourself, making it a great bike for commuting or riding to the beach. 7. The bike comes with a water bottle cage and front/rear reflectors to comply with local codes. 8.  It's fifty bucks.  If you are handy with bicycles, this is sort of a no-brainer, as I'm sure you can save a lot of money swapping parts off other bikes and/or handling installation of any new parts by yourself.  If you are not, the beauty of this bike is that, even after paying a local bike mechanic to perform all the optional upgrades and add-ons suggested above, it falls within the price range of the less expensive department store bikes that are hard to come by right now.

Check out the all-new 2022 Honda Grom, probably the most fun you‚Äôll ever have on two wheels. There‚Äôs especially big news this year, because we‚Äôve made some huge improvements to this little pocket rocket. A new engine, with a higher 10:1 compression ratio that increases power and adds to the bike‚Äôs zippy performance. And an extra gear in the transmission‚Äîthat‚Äôs right, it‚Äôs a five-speed now. Updated digital instruments. Plus a thicker, flatter seat that‚Äôs more comfortable and a better fit for taller riders. But the biggest news of all are the Grom‚Äôs new body panels. They give the Grom a fresh new look, and they‚Äôre easy to remove for customizing your ride. You even get fuel injection, a bigger fuel tank.",unknown,0.0,0.0,unknown,hybrid/comfort,unknown,0.0,unknown,unknown,0.0,unknown,0,0,0,0,10

It‚Äôs just the right size for younger riders, with the perfect combination of features to make learning as entertaining as riding. The four-stroke engine provides smooth power delivery that‚Äôs easy to harness, and the automatic clutch means riders can focus on the fundamentals without worrying about stalling. Along the way, an adjustable throttle limiter and keyed ignition lets you control its power output. And this year, it comes with new graphics inspired by our champion-motocrossers. The CRF50F is a learning tool, a bonding opportunity, and nonstop fun.Features may include:PERFORMANCEDURABLE, LOW-MAINTENANCE ENGINEIf there‚Äôs one thing you can count on with a Honda, it‚Äôs the engine. The CRF50F‚Äôs Honda four-stroke is famously reliable. That cuts down on frustration and hassles.CONVENIENCEAUTOMATIC CLUTCHBecause there's no clutch lever to master, new riders don‚Äôt have to worry about stalling. That makes the CRF50F the perfect tool for learning to shift. In addition, the smooth transmission offers three gear ratios.CONVENIENCEKEYED IGNITIONA removable key helps ensure younger riders can‚Äôt ride without an adult‚Äôs supervision. Got their homework done early? Let‚Äôs go riding!ENGINEERINGADJUSTABLE THROTTLE LIMITERSet the top speed by turning a screw. That helps keep new riders from going too fast, too soon, and lets you match the CRF50F's power output to the rider's skill level.RUGGED STEEL FRAMENew riders are hard on equipment, especially when they‚Äôre just starting out. That‚Äôs why the CRF50F uses a strong steel frame that‚Äôs built to handle the bumps and dings of off-road riding.STYLINGTOUGH BODYWORKLearning to ride is all about - well, learning. And that can be tough on a bike. So we made the CRF50F even tougher. With plastic fenders, tank and other body parts, it‚Äôs designed to shrug off dings and scrapes. And with styling inspired by its pro-motocross big brothers, the CRF50F looks like a champ too.

Riding weather is back so one last time...  This is a 2000 Vianelli Corsa in excellent condition and ready to ride. It used to be my go-to but I no longer ride like I did.  Tires, cables and housings, chain, brake pads, bar tape were replaced recently. Bike has been refurbished and tuned, all bearings replaced, cleaned and lubricated. Components include the 9x2 speed Campagnolo Daytona group (18 speeds total), Campagnolo Athena headset and cartridge bottom bracket, Miche seatpost, Shimano SPD-S pedals, Velocity Fusion rimmed wheels with Campagnolo hubs and Vittoria Rubino 23c tires.  Size is 62cm (24.4 inches) center crank to top of seat tube. Stand-over clearance at the top tube is 33.5 inches and the bike will fit from 32 - 36 inch inseams with some variation depending on the individual.  Top tube is 58cm center-center.   The frame is constructed of Dedaccaiai Zero Uno, very light and strong Italian butted steel tubing with Columbus dropouts.  The bike weighs just under 23lbs as pictured.  The craftsmanship is very good - The joins, chrome and paintwork are excellent.   $500 cash and local pick up only please. Text and emails are preferred between 9am and 6pm.  Some background on the brand:  Vianelli bikes are more common in Italy than here in the US, they were not widely exported. Made in Brescia where Pierfranco Vianelli opened his shop after retiring from professional cycling. This bike was purchased from the original owner in Brescia.  Vianelli won the 1968 Olympics gold medal in the Individual Road Race, after he left racing he built bikes himself and also built frames for Marinoni. Later he also contracted some out to area framebuilders.  Vianelli still has a store in Brescia, now run by his son.",4,1.0,1.0,steel,road,special,0.0,3,special,0.0,29,0,0,0,0,25

Factory Description: Whether it's a weekend trip to the farmers market or a daily commute to work, the PUBLIC C7i will take you anywhere you desire to go in comfort and style. Like all PUBLIC Bikes, the PUBLIC C7i is built around our high quality ""smooth as butter"" steel frame and includes painted to match rims, chain guard and fenders, color coordinated cables, and our new streamlined city comfort saddle in Antique Brown with matching premium bolt-on handgrips.  What makes the PUBLIC C7i our best Dutch commuter bike is the easy-shifting Shimano Nexus 7-speed internally geared rear hub. This robust, durable and low maintenance shifting system makes changing gears a breeze, and allows the rider to select the ideal gear whether pedaling or at a full stop. This is particularly helpful when riding around town where stoplights and stop signs necessitate frequent shifting. In addition to the upgraded and simplified drivetrain, the PUBLIC C7i receives our strongest double walled alloy rims, which will provide years of trouble free service, even over the roughest pavement.  Often referred to as a 'Dutch bike,' the PUBLIC C7i shares the same high quality steel step-through frame as the C1 and C7. This Dutch commuter bike style has been popular with women and men in Europe for decades, in part because it's easy to get on and off in pants and dresses alike. Like all PUBLIC bikes, the PUBLIC C7i includes front and rear rack mounts making it easy to add a rack and carry items with a pannier or basket. Many PUBLIC owners choose to further customize their bikes with Brooks saddles and special grips.  In keeping with our love for simple, clean and functional bicycles, the PUBLIC C7i includes everything you need and nothing you don't. In addition to the smooth shifting Shimano Nexus 7 speed hub, the PUBLIC C7i comes standard with powerful modern dual pivot brakes to ensure safe and reliable braking in all conditions. Also standard on all PUBLIC C7i bikes are tires with 3M reflective sidewalls to provide additional visibility and safety at night. We designed the PUBLIC C7i to meet the requests of customers who asked for a high quality, stylish and fun, internally geared city bike with function and versatility. We love the PUBLIC C7i and are so sure that you will too!",4,1.0,1.0,steel,hybrid/comfort,unknown,0.0,3,unknown,0.0,29,0,0,0,0,8

Listing details:  * QUICK RELEASE: The handle at the stationary bike trainer not only can release the bike off the trainer quickly by lifting up, but also can lock the bike to the trainer quickly by pressing down. Very simple and convenient, the indoor bike trainer is easy for everyone to handle. * 6 SPEED RESISTANCE: With a remote controller of 6-level speed by a wire, you can change resistance to comply with the cycling conditions you want and enjoy different riding experiences. After quick installation, you can begin to ride. 1-2 speed offer less resistance when comparing with the 5 or 6 spped. * STEADY, STABLE AND FIRM: The indoor exercise bike trainer is designed with dual-support structure. The wide frame and front wheel riser block included in the package keep it away from wobbling and reach unshakable balance. The steady base and adjustable anti-slip rubber feet fits for uneven floor in different conditions, preventing movement for stability on any surface. * SMOOTH IN SPIN: When riding a bike at home, a smooth bike exercise trainer is definitely necessary. Bike trainer with noise reduction resistance wheel makes your cycling virtually silent. BTW, if noise is loud, it has a lot to do with the materials and tread of bike tires, we sincerely suggest you to use a slick tire. * COMPATIBLE WITH BIKES: The Unisky indoor riding bicycle training stand fits bikes with a 26-28"" or 700c wheel, most road or mountain bikes . There is no need to buy a new one if you have a road or mountain bike of normal size. Bring your bike inside and begin indoor cycling workout. After exercise, take the bike off the trainer, fold the bike trainer and put it at any corner.  Load capacity 300lb",4,1.0,0.0,unknown,mountain,unknown,0.0,unknown,unknown,0.0,unknown,0,0,0,0,8

The same pin can also be used to tilt the rack down 20 degrees for easier bike loading. The tilting feature can also be used when the is rack fully loaded, so you can gain easier access to your vehicle's rear cargo area without unloading your bikes.  Removable 2-Bike Add-On The rack includes a 2-bike add-on that installs easily onto the base rack. When it's not needed, simply remove the add-on with the included special tool and throw it in your trunk or leave it at home. To install the add-on on your HoldUp, simply remove the endcap from the bike rack base, slide the add-on's shank into the hole on the bike rack, and secure the shank with a bolt that comes with the add-on. The add-on includes a safty flag post to ensure that the rack is visible to other vehicles on the road.   Wheel-Mount Design for Easy Bike Loading The HoldUp is easy to load, even if your bikes have monster wheels. The deep, contoured front wheel cradles accommodate just about any wheel out there, and the pivoting arms with StrongArm technology ensure that your bikes are held firmly in place. To load a bike, simply place your front wheel in the holder, rotate the pivoting arm up and over the wheel, and press down firmly on the ratcheting hook. To release the hook, simply press the built-in red button and slide the hook up and off your wheel. Large rear wheel holders allow the HoldUp to accommodate a wide variety of bike wheelbases. These wheel holders pivot front to back, adjusting automatically to your wheel size - no need for sliding and tightening. Secure the wheels in place with the ratcheting straps built into each holder. Mounting bikes by the wheels helps prevent any scratches or scuffs to the paint. The ratcheting hooks are padded, however, so they won't mar your wheels. And the pivot mechanisms in the arms are overbuilt to ensure they keep functioning smoothly over a lifetime of hard use.",4,0.0,0.0,unknown,road,unknown,0.0,unknown,unknown,0.0,unknown,0,0,0,0,8

Not many men's bikes survived.     Free Spirit was a Sears and Roebuck brand.  Their name does not appear on the bike. ""Sunbird"" does appear on the crossbar.  I assume it is a model name.    It is a 10 speed with two levers as shown in photos.  Both cables are attached to front and rear derailleurs.  They work but need adjusting. Hand brakes are cable operated but need adjusting.    Wheels are 27"" and use 27 x 1 1/4 tires and tubes.  Both wheels are true.  Tires appear to be original to the bike.  They are will need replacing.   Should be perfect for restoration without a lot of time and expensive parts.  Everything is there.   All cables and the chain are in good shape.  Nothing on the bike is frozen up and is still usable.    The maroon paint looks great even for its age.  The chrome handlebars have some surface rust but will clean up just fine with some naval jelly and steel wool. One photo attempts to show my quick effort to show this.

Full carbon frameset.  Full Ultegra groupset.  This model has Trek's ISOSpeed feature... for an even smoother ride than carbon fiber frames already give.  https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/inside_trek/isospeed/  Frame sticker says this is a 56cm.  But also says the top tube is more of a 55cm.  Complete specs here:  https://archive.trekbikes.com/ca/en/2014/Trek/domane_4_7_wsd_compact  Technically this is a WSD / women's model... but road bike frames are unisex so only the ""touch points"" are different (handlebar and saddle) on the female versions... and the paint colors / graphics.  And this particular color scheme is not particularly girly.  (White and charcoal w/ a couple of dark fuscia TREK logos.)  In terms of sizing, if you ride a 56cm bike, you ride a 56cm bike... there is no ""womens 56cm"" or ""mens 56cm"".  56cm is 56cm.   Bike has normal wear from typical recreational riding... but overall is in fantastic condition.  Height-wise, for a 55/56cm frame you should be in the 5'8 to 5'11 range... but could certainly work for someone a little smaller or a little taller with some fitting.  I will include the after-market accessories... water bottle cages, tail bag (behind the saddle), and frame bag (behind stem)... and the CatEye trip computer.    The bike was just at Fletcher Bike Studio in Montrose getting new bar tape and a light tune up / adjustment... just to make sure it is perfect for the next owner.  (Great bike shop by the way!)  The Domane is Trek's ""endurance"" road platform... which means less aggressive / more comfortable right out of the box than their racier bikes (like the Madone and the Emonda).  You could certainly tweak this bike to get it more racey if that's what you're looking for.  But most people are looking for a good combination of speed and comfort.  And that's what the Domane is all about.  Love the bike but I upgraded to a newer model.  54cm 55cm 57cm specialzed roubaix giant propel tcr defy 54 55 56 cm",4,0.0,0.0,carbon fiber,road,special,0.0,unknown,unknown,0.0,unknown,0,0,0,0,9

Looks tight.  58cm full OCLV carbon fiber frameset. (Ideal for riders in the 5'-10"" to 6'-2"" range... with the sweet spot being somewhere in the middle.)   Full Shimano Ultegra groupset.   (3x10 w/ a (rare) long cage rear derailleur for larger cassette capacity) = 30 speeds.  Excellent for weekend hill country riding, MS-150, the Rockies on vacation, etc.  The bike is in very good condition, with normal wear from typical riding. Never crashed. Always stored indoors and professionally maintained.   Just had Fletcher Bike Studio install a brand new ($65 Ultegra 12/23) cassette and brand new ($35 KMC) chain + new cables and housings, then re-adjust shifting to perfection.  Also had them re-wrap the bars with new bar tape.  (Total = $150)  So, short of a major component or wheel failure--which is rare--the bike should be good for thousands of miles without needing any major service.  This bike is very light for a road bike (around 17 to 17.5 lbs).  The 5.2 Madones are very highly rated / reviewed by their owners.  https://www.roadbikereview.com/product/latest-bikes/road-bike/trek/madone-5-2.html?p=8  This particular bike is more or less factory original... with the exception of upgraded wheels and tires (red anodized Mavic Heliums with red Continental Grand Prix 4000's) and the water bottle cages... and the above mentioned major service that was just done.  (Zero miles since service.)  Bike is 100% ready for the road today.  Needs nothing at all.  Just clip in and go.

The rebuild included several modifications that are debatably factory due to the fact that I hunted and picked through the bone yard to pull the very best K0 camshaft, cam towers, rockers, shafts, etc. I pieced each together utilizing the best of each year of the 750 to maximize the power output ‚ÄúWITHOUT‚Äù increasing displacement. Essentially this bike has been gone through with power in mind, but I have not bored it out. Rather old parts have been replaced with either new stock sizes or lightly used parts. Everything and I mean EVERYTHING in the top end has been hand lightened, the head completely ported and polished, including combustion chambers, as well as domed (higher compression) pistons installed.  	‚ÅÉ	All electrical parts have been gone through with the points replaced, then essentially bypassed with a transistorized ignition, new coils, upgraded advance unit, modified advance springs, and so on. All in all everything is LED and the headlight alone is amazing to say the least. The electrical upgrades completely removed the 750 flat spot in the mid range and have overall reduced the workload that the wiring has to deal with. All of this improves reliability, performance, and safety.  	‚ÅÉ	The tires alone are over $500 in rubber and MAN do they hug the corners. 	‚ÅÉ	The suspension has been completely gone through, with fork seals and oil replaced. The triple tree clamps cracked on me on my way to work one day, so I bought a joker machine replacement set that are solid billet aluminum with taper steering stem bearings installed. 	‚ÅÉ	The front and rear wheels have been professionally trued and bearing have been replaced with the tires at end of last riding season.  	‚ÅÉ	The front wheels hub does not come stock setup to be able to receive a second (yes that‚Äôs right second, as in dual disk) disk, but I have machined the hub and have the second disk on the front wheel now. I also have the second brake setup complete, but you would just need to get the brake line for it. Cool part about the triple clamp is that it actually acts as the hydraulic splitter for the front end. So everything is set to go, I just never got around to getting it done.  	‚ÅÉ	There are two completely different set of pipes based on your preference. One is an after market 4 into 1 that is on it now. I personally don‚Äôt like or prefer this set, but haven‚Äôt had the time to swap them back to the original 4 into 4 chrome pipes. With all of the upgrades done to bike I thought it might do well with the 4 into 1 pipe, but honestly have been disappointed. The performance, sound, and look of the originals far out way the 4 into 1 set. Both come with the bike though.   I could go on and on about this bike if you couldn‚Äôt tell, but sadly a ‚Äúdeal with the devil‚Äù, just kidding a deal with my wife is causing me to have to give this prize up. Lame or stupid as I may sound I REALLY REALLY want this bike to go to someone who will love it the way that I have. Give it a good home if you will. The trick with ‚Äúold‚Äù bikes is that they need a certain amount of care and most people don‚Äôt get that. They just ride it and don‚Äôt take care of what they have. Really the only thing that hasn‚Äôt been updated in this bike is it‚Äôs cosmetics. The tank has a small ding and a scratch, but the seat, tank, and side panels are all from the 70‚Äôs. Quality stuff really.  I also have two full bins chalk full of parts for this baby. I am happy to include most of them.",unknown,0.0,0.0,aluminum,unknown,hydraulic,0.0,unknown,unknown,0.0,unknown,0,0,0,0,11

It has a 60 volt, 1800 watt electrical system.  The batteries are each 16s2p (60 volt, 6 amp-hours) batteries, which are connected in parallel for greater capacity (60 volt, 12 amp-hours). I know the label on the batteries says they are 20000 mAh, but that's not true - just a fake value from the distributor.  The motor is a 48v, 1500w hub motor, which I have over-volted to 60v for greater top speed.  The top speed of the bike is about 25 mph, and the range is about 10 miles. Not a ton of range, but good for quick trips around town.  Feel free to reach out with any questions! I accept cash and Venmo - no trades. Text only, and I'm open to offers.

I replaced the original pedals, front ring, chain, seat, rear tire, and handlebars with my own. I still have the original 42 tooth front ring, original handlebars, and a spare chain. Also has a bell installed.  I can change out the front ring for you when you come if you want so that it's easier to ride.  I also have flat pedals if you don't want the clipless pedals  Price is negotiable. text is the best way to get ahold of me.",4,1.0,1.0,steel,road,unknown,0.0,3,unknown,0.0,29,0,0,0,0,14

Did it succeed? Or was it just trying to please all the people all the time? Around 1980, the full-size motorcycle market began splintering into numerous niches, including the Factory Custom. Seats grew steps, bars pulled back, footpegs inched forward, and clean drive shafts replaced messy chains. No doubt mindful that its game-changing V4s were in the pipeline, Honda stretched its trusty 4-valve inline 750cc to 900cc, then laid back its ergonomics to take on Suzuki‚Äôs cruiser GS850/1100GL and Yamaha‚Äôs similarly-themed XS1100 Special. Essentially, Honda hijacked the engine from its Euro-spec CB900F to power the CB900C. The air-cooled, 16-valve double overhead cam with pent-roof combustion chambers was fed by four 32mm Keihin carburetors. A single-piece forged crankshaft drove a jackshaft via a Hy-Vo chain, with gear drive from the jackshaft to the clutch and 5-speed tranny. Shaft drive was de rigueur in the custom class, so to keep development costs down Honda borrowed the final drive unit from the GL1100 to use on the 900C. There was, however, one minor problem using the GL unit: the CB900‚Äôs tranny output was on the bike‚Äôs left side, and the GL1100‚Äôs shaft was on the right. Honda‚Äôs solution was a crossover shaft ‚Äî actually, two shafts incorporating two pairs of gears. This gave the CB900C a 2-speed ‚ÄúSelect Range‚Äù secondary transmission sitting in its own transfer case, complete with its own trochoidal oil pump for lubrication. And while it wasn‚Äôt as complicated as it sounds, it wasn‚Äôt exactly simple.¬†Cycle¬†magazine counted ‚Äú20 gears, six shafts, a dozen bearings, three torque cushions, a U-joint and assorted couplings employed in making the crank/rear wheel connection.‚Äù The 2-speed transfer case meant 10 forward gears, giving CB900C riders incredible flexibility in gearing. It also went a long way toward the bike‚Äôs reasonable fuel economy. Kept in ‚Äúhigh‚Äù range, reports of 50mpg were common. That said, left in ‚Äúlow‚Äù range and ridden with a heavy right hand the CB900C would return as little as 30mpg. Yet the multitude of driveline components allowed generous driveline lash, which, combined with lean EPA-mandated carburetion, made for herky-jerky throttle transitions ‚Äúthe like of which you won‚Äôt find in any other motorcycle presently in production,‚Äù¬†Cycle¬†said. The extra transmission case also stretched the frame, and thus lengthened the wheelbase to a Harley-esque 62 inches ‚Äî even using a short swingarm. This latter item introduced its own problems, causing noticeable torque jacking under acceleration and a lack of rear end traction under braking, chirping the rear tire. And the C-bike weighed in at nearly 590 pounds ready to ride, making it just about the heaviest machine in its class. In most other respects, though, the 900C worked really well. Testers praised its electric-motor-like power delivery; lack of vibration (the engine was rubber-mounted); straight-line performance (less than 12.5 seconds at almost 110mph in the quarter mile ‚Äî on¬† par with the XS11 and GS11); adjustable air-assisted suspension (also derived from the GL1100); and even its handling ‚Äî in spite of a lazy 29-degree steering angle and squirmy 16-inch rear tire. Comfort was good (though the stepped seat trapped the rider in one position), brakes powerful and resistant to fade, and the 2-speed tranny reduced engine speed by a useful 500rpm at highway cruising speeds ‚Äî and fuel consumption by as much as 16 percent if left in high. Even so,¬†Cycle Guide¬†concluded the extra five gears ‚Äúbordered on the redundant‚Äù and a similar result ‚Äúcould easily have been accomplished with a 6-speed transmission.‚Äù Built to Honda‚Äôs typically high standards, CB900Cs could pile on the miles. The 2-speed transfer case doesn‚Äôt appear to have any negative impact on reliability, and like other Honda fours the 900C had few major problem areas. But what really baffled testers was how to classify the CB900C. Was it a cruiser, a tourer or a new type of sport bike? Though intended to appeal to American buyers, the custom styling left¬†Cycle Guide¬†testers cold. One called it the ‚ÄúKing Kong Kompromise Kruiser,‚Äù while another considered it a dinosaur and hoped its inevitable extinction would ‚Äúmark a return to a more sensible line of motorcycles where sheer size is not a prime factor.‚Äù A third thought it had been ‚Äúdressed by committee.‚Äù Ultimately, it was a bike in search of a market, and while briefly popular, it was dropped after just three years in Honda‚Äôs lineup. It‚Äôs perhaps ironic to note that the CB900C, a decidedly large bike when introduced, looks like a featherweight alongside today‚Äôs gargantuan boulevard bikes. Maybe it was just 30 years ahead of its time.WE BUY CARS AND CONSIGN CARSMORE PICTURES and VIDEO CLIPS ON OUR WEBSITE: www.DesertPrivateCollection.comWE BUY CLASSIC CARS - CONSIGN and SELL -¬†PHOTO SHOOT RENTAL IS AVAILABLECalifornia buyers must pay CA sales tax , all prices in USD .¬† Disclaimer-Finance Requirements listed at our website-Price does not include sales tax and DMV registration feesMonthly payment is based on approved Credit for more Inventory VISIT OUR WEBSITE¬†https://www.desertprivatecollection.com/ or call¬†(760) 313-6607FOR CONSIGNMENT PLEASE CONTACT¬†US¬†(760) 313-6607This head turning 1980 Honda CR 900 Standard fits your budget at $2,750.

Always stored in garage, never exposed to weather. normal wear, fully funtional and very sturdy.

The best selling SAMSON HD and SAMSON 2.0 Fat Tire bikes come with the powerful and durable BAFANG 1000 that peaks at 1650 watts. Our Samson MID DRIVES start at $2549 for the red Samson 2.0, and range up to $2749 for the charchoal Samson HD. Starting at $2849, The ORION is a purpose built hunting bike that will literally climb a mountain to get that illusive elk. The long list of available upgrades includes full suspension, hydraulic brakes, 1650 watts of power, and a 52 volt, 20 AH battery...The list goes on, and on. These are very well suited for off road riders, hunters, beach riders, or anyone who loves a ton of power on the street. The Samson Mid Drives are not your everyday Ebike. Unlike the usual ""Budget Amazon bike"" or some local flavor, These are built to put out a lot of power AND consistently travel 50+ miles per charge. They are designed to climb hills, travel fast for commuting, or excel at beach riding. We use a 48 or 52 volt 20 AH battery for outstanding range. Some riders say they are getting in excess of 50 miles with a 1000 watt Samson. Most bikes can come with fenders, racks, lights, and many other accessories. We also offer some bikes that are more suited for street use such as ""RADIUS,"" our street bike or ""Northwest Fox,"" our recumbent electric bike. We also offer trikes, both standard and fat tire. Delivery is free within 100 miles of Albany, OR! It is also same or next day on most bikes. Please call show 541-905-seven486 .
